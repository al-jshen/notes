# Sampling

Problem: Given a known probability distribution, how do you draw samples from it?

Motivation: probability distributions can be hard to work with. But if you have samples from the distribution, you can easily calculate expectation values involving that distribution (e.g., means, marginal likelihoods, etc.) using those samples. You can also use those samples to run simulations (generative modelling).
