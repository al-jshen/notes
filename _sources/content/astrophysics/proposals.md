# Writing proposals

## Rubric

1. impact on subfield
2. broader impact on astronomy/science
3. suitability (why this telescope is the one that is best suited for this science task)

## Outline

- Motivation/impact.
- High-level statement of what you would do.
- Quickly get to science question, what is the uncertainty left to solve?
- I alone can solve it if I had access to this telescope. Please give me time.

## Experimental Design

- {Instrument} excels at doing {task}, which will enable me to do {amazing thing}
- Only need a small amount of time to gather a sample
- With this sample in hand, I will be able to:

1. characterize {thing}
2. measure {thing}

## Technical Justification

This is the SNR I would get at this wavelength with this many hours with this telescope. Here are some calculations I've done that show that I would need some SNR at this wavelength to measure what I want.
For computing proposals, might include results from scaling tests for your code on a smaller cluster.
