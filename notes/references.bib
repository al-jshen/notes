  abstract = {We describe the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, a robotic imaging system optimized for the detection of extended ultra\textendash low surface brightness structures. The array consists of eight Canon 400 mm f=2:8 L IS II USM telephoto lenses coupled to eight science-grade commercial CCD cameras. The lenses are mounted on a common framework and are coaligned to simultaneously image the same position on the sky. The system provides an imaging capability equivalent to a 0.4 m aperture f=1:0 refractor with a 2:6\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 1:9\textdegree{} field of view. The system is driven by custom software for instrument control and robotic operation. Data is collected with noncommon optical paths through each lens, and with careful tracking of sky variations in order to minimize systematic errors that limit the accuracy of background estimation and flat-fielding. The system has no obstructions in the light path, optimized baffling, and internal optical surfaces coated with a new generation of antireflection coatings based on subwavelength nanostructures. As a result, the array's point-spread function has a factor of {$\sim$}10 less scattered light at large radii than well-baffled reflecting telescopes. The Dragonfly Telephoto Array is capable of imaging extended structures to surface brightness levels below {$\mu$}B {$\frac{1}{4}$} 30 mag arcsec\`A2 in {$\sim$}10 h integrations (without binning or foreground star removal). This is considerably deeper than the surface brightness limit of any existing wide-field telescope. At present, no systematic errors limiting the usefulness of much longer integration times have been identified. With longer integrations (50\textendash 100 h), foreground star removal, and modest binning, the Dragonfly Telephoto Array is capable of probing structures with surface brightnesses below {$\mu$}B {$\frac{1}{4}$} 32 mag arcsec\`A2. The detection of structures at these surface brightness levels may hold the key to solving the ``missing substructure'' and ``missing satellite'' problems of conventional hierarchical galaxy formation models. The Dragonfly Telephoto Array is therefore executing a fully automated multiyear imaging survey of a complete sample of nearby galaxies in order to undertake the first census of ultrafaint substructures in the nearby universe.},

  abstract = {Investigations of the origin and evolution of the Milky Way disc have long relied on chemical and kinematic identifications of its components to reconstruct our Galactic past. Difficulties in determining precise stellar ages have restricted most studies to small samples, normally confined to the solar neighbourhood. Here, we break this impasse with the help of asteroseismic inference and perform a chronology of the evolution of the disc throughout the age of the Galaxy. We chemically dissect the Milky Way disc population using a sample of red giant stars spanning out to 2 kpc in the solar annulus observed by the Kepler satellite, with the added dimension of asteroseismic ages. Our results reveal a clear difference in age between the low- and high-{$\alpha$} populations, which also show distinct velocity dispersions in the V and W components. We find no tight correlation between age and metallicity nor [{$\alpha$}/Fe] for the high-{$\alpha$} disc stars. Our results indicate that this component formed over a period of more than 2 Gyr with a wide range of [M/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] independent of time. Our findings show that the kinematic properties of young {$\alpha$}-rich stars are consistent with the rest of the high-{$\alpha$} population and different from the low-{$\alpha$} stars of similar age, rendering support to their origin being old stars that went through a mass transfer or stellar merger event, making them appear younger, instead of migration of truly young stars formed close to the Galactic bar.},

  abstract = {The last two decades have seen a major expansion in the availability, size, and precision of time-domain datasets in astronomy. Owing to their unique combination of flexibility, mathematical simplicity and comparative robustness, Gaussian Processes (GPs) have emerged recently as the solution of choice to model stochastic signals in such datasets. In this review we provide a brief introduction to the emergence of GPs in astronomy, present the underlying mathematical theory, and give practical advice considering the key modelling choices involved in GP regression. We then review applications of GPs to time-domain datasets in the astrophysical literature so far, from exoplanets to active galactic nuclei, showcasing the power and flexibility of the method. We provide worked examples using simulated data, with links to the source code, discuss the problem of computational cost and scalability, and give a snapshot of the current ecosystem of open source GP software packages. Driven by further algorithmic and conceptual advances, we expect that GPs will continue to be an important tool for robust and interpretable time domain astronomy for many years to come.},

  abstract = {Methods. GSP-Phot uses a Bayesian forward-modelling approach to simultaneously fit the BP/RP spectrum, parallax, and apparent G magnitude. A major design feature of GSP-Phot is the use of the apparent flux levels of BP/RP spectra to derive, in combination with isochrone models, tight observational constraints on radii and distances. We carefully validate the uncertainty estimates by exploiting repeat Gaia observations of the same source. Results. The data release includes GSP-Phot results for 471 million sources with G {$<$} 19. Typical differences to literature values are 110 K for Teff and 0.2-0.25 for log g, but these depend strongly on data quality. In particular, GSP-Phot results are significantly better for stars with good parallax measurements ( /{$\sigma$} {$>$} 20), mostly within 2kpc. Metallicity estimates exhibit substantial biases compared to literature values and are only useful at a qualitative level. However, we provide an empirical calibration of our metallicity estimates that largely removes these biases. Extinctions A0 and ABP show typical differences from reference values of 0.07-0.09 mag. MCMC samples of the parameters are also available for 95\% of the sources. Conclusions. GSP-Phot provides a homogeneous catalogue of stellar parameters, distances, and extinctions that can be used for various purposes, such as sample selections (OB stars, red giants, solar analogues etc.). In the context of asteroseismology or ground-based interferometry, where targets are usually bright and have good parallax measurements, GSP-Phot results should be particularly useful for combined analysis or target selection.},

  abstract = {We present a new age-dating technique that combines gyrochronology with isochrone fitting to infer ages for FGKM main-sequence and subgiant field stars. Gyrochronology and isochrone fitting are each capable of providing relatively precise ages for field stars in certain areas of the Hertzsprung\textendash Russell diagram (HRD): gyrochronology works optimally for cool main-sequence stars, and isochrone fitting can provide precise ages for stars near the main-sequence turnoff. Combined, these two age-dating techniques can provide precise and accurate ages for a broader range of stellar masses and evolutionary stages than either method used in isolation. We demonstrate that the position of a star on the HRD or color\textendash magnitude diagram can be combined with its rotation period to infer a precise age via both isochrone fitting and gyrochronology simultaneously. We show that incorporating rotation periods with 5\% uncertainties into stellar evolution models improves age precision for FGK stars on the main sequence and can, on average, provide age estimates up to three times more precise than isochrone fitting alone. In addition, we provide a new gyrochronology relation, calibrated to the Praesepe cluster and the Sun, that includes a variance model to capture the rotational behavior of stars whose rotation periods do not lengthen with the square root of time and parts of the HRD where gyrochronology has not been calibrated. This publication is accompanied by an open-source Python package (stardate) for inferring the ages of mainsequence and subgiant FGKM stars from rotation periods, spectroscopic parameters, and/or apparent magnitudes and parallaxes.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the relations between gas kinematics, metallicity, and stellar mass in a sample of 82 GRB-selected galaxies using absorption and emission methods. We find the velocity widths of both emission and absorption profiles to be a proxy of stellar mass. We also investigate the velocity-metallicity correlation and its evolution with redshift and find the correlation derived from emission lines to have a significantly smaller scatter compared to that found using absorption lines. Using 33 GRB hosts with measured stellar mass and metallicitiy, we study the mass-metallicity relation for GRB host galaxies in a stellar mass range of \$10\^\{8.2\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ to \$10\^\{11.1\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and a redshift range of \$ z\textbackslash sim 0.3-3.4\$. The GRB-selected galaxies appear to track the mass-metallicity relation of star forming galaxies but with an offset of 0.15 towards lower metallicities. This offset is comparable with the average error-bar on the metallicity measurements of the GRB sample and also the scatter on the MZ relation of the general population. It is hard to decide whether this relatively small offset is due to systematic effects or the intrinsic nature of GRB hosts. We also investigate the possibility of using absorption-line metallicity measurements of GRB hosts to study the mass-metallicity relation at high redshifts. Our analysis shows that the metallicity measurements from absorption methods can significantly differ from emission metallicities and assuming identical measurements from the two methods may result in erroneous conclusions.},

  abstract = {Marine vertebrate strandings offer an opportunistic sampling scheme that can provide abundant data over long periods. Because the stranding process involves biological, physical and sociological parameters, confounding complicates the interpretation of results. The statistical analysis of these data relies on generalized linear or additive models in order to infer long-term trends, but does not easily account for drift or variation in reporting rates. Here, we capitalized on county-level (administrative) variation following the passing of a law for compulsory reporting of stranded marine mammals in France to investigate how variation in reporting rates may affect the observed trend in stranded small delphinids in the Bay of Biscay. Using a time-series spanning more than 30 years across eight administrative counties, we built variance partitioning models for the analysis of count data. We discussed the choice of an appropriate likelihood to conclude the Negative Binomial useful and interpretable in the context of small delphinid strandings. We expanded the model with a recent methodology to detect structural breaks in the time series, focusing on overdispersion. We performed statistical robustness checks with respect to variations in reporting rates and discuss their causal interpretation in the context of observational data. Stranding frequencies increased on average 7-fold over 30 years. We conclude that reporting rates to the French stranding network have been stable since the early 1990s, and the average 3-fold increase in stranded small delphinids observed in the Bay of Biscay since 1990 is due to other factors, including bycatch. Codes and data are available to replicate the analysis to other national stranding networks. \textcopyright{} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract = {We have used the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer to map CO(3-2) emission from the gravitationally lensed Lyman break galaxy MS1512-cB58. This is the first detection of a molecular emission line in any Lyman break system; its integrated intensity implies a total molecular gas mass of 6.6e9 Msun, while its width implies a dynamical mass of 1.0e10 csc\^2i Msun (for a flat Lambda=0.7 cosmology). These estimates are in excellent concordance with nearly all parameters of the system measured at other wavelengths, and yield a consistent picture of past and future star formation with no obvious discrepancies requiring explanation by differential lensing. In particular, we find that the age and remaining lifetime of the current episode of star formation are likely to be similar; the surface densities of star formation and molecular gas mass are related by a Schmidt law; and the fraction of baryonic mass already converted into stars is sufficient to account for the observed enrichment of the interstellar medium to 0.4 Zsun. Barring substantial gas inflow or a major merger, the stars forming in the current episode will have mass and coevality at z=0 similar to those of a spiral bulge. Assuming cB58 is a typical Lyman break galaxy apart from its magnification, its global parameters suggest that the prescriptions for star formation used in some semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution require moderate revision, although the general prediction that gas mass fraction should increase with redshift is validated.

We observe that the generative behavior of diffusion models is not strongly dependent on the choice of image degradation, and in fact an entire family of generative models can be constructed by varying this choice. Even when using completely deterministic degradations (e.g., blur, masking, and more), the training and test-time update rules that underlie diffusion models can be easily generalized to create generative models. The success of these fully deterministic models calls into question the community's understanding of diffusion models, which relies on noise in either gradient Langevin dynamics or variational inference, and paves the way for generalized diffusion models that invert arbitrary processes.

  abstract = {We propose a simple interpretation of the rotation period data for solar- and late-type stars. The open cluster and Mount Wilson star observations suggest that rotating stars lie primarily on two sequences, initially called I and C. Some stars lie in the intervening gap. These sequences, and the fractional numbers of stars on each sequence, evolve systematically with cluster age, enabling us to construct crude rotational isochrones allowing `` stellar gyrochronology,'' a procedure, on improvement, likely to yield ages for individual field stars. The age and color dependences of the sequences allow the identification of the underlying mechanism, which appears to be primarily magnetic. The majority of solar- and late-type stars possess a dominant Sun-like, or interface, magnetic field, which connects the convective envelope to both the radiative interior of the star and the exterior, where winds can drain off angular momentum. These stars spin down Skumanich style. An age-decreasing fraction of young G, K, and M stars, which are rapid rotators, possess only a convective field, which is not only inefficient in depleting angular momentum but also incapable of coupling the surface convection zone to the inner radiative zone, so that only the outer zone is spun down, and on an exponential timescale. These stars do not yet possess large-scale dynamos. The large-scale magnetic field associated with the dynamo, apparently created by the shear between the decoupled radiative and convective zones, (re)couples the convective and radiative zones and drives a star from the convective to the interface sequence through the gap on a timescale that increases as stellar mass decreases. Fully convective stars do not possess such an interface, cannot generate an interface dynamo, and hence can never make such a transition. Helioseismic results for the present-day Sun agree with this scheme, which also explains the rotational bimodality observed by Herbst and collaborators among pre\textendash main-sequence stars and the termination of this bimodality when stars become fully convective. This paradigm also provides a new basis for understanding stellar X-ray and chromospheric activity, light-element abundances, and perhaps other stellar phenomena that depend on rotation.},

Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names ``dynamic computational graphs'' and ``differentiable programming''. We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms ``autodiff'', ``automatic differentiation'', and ``symbolic differentiation'' as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

  abstract = {The compositions of stars are a critical diagnostic tool for many topics in astronomy such as the evolution of our Galaxy, the formation of planets, and the uniqueness of the Sun. Previous spectroscopic measurements indicate a large intrinsic variation in the elemental abundance patterns of stars with similar overall metal content. However, systematic errors arising from inaccuracies in stellar models are known to be a limiting factor in such studies, and thus it is uncertain to what extent the observed diversity of stellar abundance patterns is real. Here we report the abundances of 30 elements with precisions of 2\% for 79 Sun-like stars within 100 pc. Systematic errors are minimized in this study by focusing on solar twin stars and performing a line-by-line differential analysis using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra. We resolve [X/Fe] abundance trends in galactic chemical evolution at precisions of 10-3 dex Gyr-1 and reveal that stars with similar ages and metallicities have nearly identical abundance patterns. Contrary to previous results, we find that the ratios of carbon-to-oxygen and magnesium-tosilicon in solar-metallicity stars are homogeneous to within 10\% throughout the solar neighborhood, implying that exoplanets may exhibit much less compositional diversity than previously thought. Finally, we demonstrate that the Sun has a subtle deficiency in refractory material relative to {$>$}80\% of solar twins (at 2{$\sigma$} confidence), suggesting a possible signpost for planetary systems like our own.},

The method is constrained by galaxies' observed stellar mass functions, SFRs (specific and cosmic), quenched fractions, ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions, UV\textendash stellar mass relations, IRX\textendash UV relations, auto- and cross-correlation functions (including quenched and star-forming subsamples), and quenching dependence on environment; each observable is reproduced over the full redshift range available, up to 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 10. Key findings include the following: galaxy assembly correlates strongly with halo assembly; quenching correlates strongly with halo mass; quenched fractions at fixed halo mass decrease with increasing redshift; massive quenched galaxies reside in higher-mass haloes than star-forming galaxies at fixed galaxy mass; star-forming and quenched galaxies' star formation histories at fixed mass differ most at z {$<$} 0.5; satellites have large scatter in quenching time-scales after infall, and have modestly higher quenched fractions than central galaxies; Planck cosmologies result in up to 0.3 dex lower stellar \textendash{} halo mass ratios at early times; and, none the less, stellar mass\textendash halo mass ratios rise at z {$>$} 5. Also presented are revised stellar mass \textendash{} halo mass relations for all, quenched, star-forming, central, and satellite galaxies; the dependence of star formation histories on halo mass, stellar mass, and galaxy SSFR; quenched fractions and quenching time-scale distributions for satellites; and predictions for higher-redshift galaxy correlation functions and weak lensing surface densities.

  abstract = {Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias\textendash variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias\textendash variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This ``double-descent'' curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias\textendash variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.},

  abstract = {Context: SMM J04542-0301 is an extended ({$\sim$}1{${'}$}) submm source located near the core of the cluster MS0451.6-0305. It has been suggested that part of its emission arises from the interaction between a LBG and two EROs at z {$\sim$} 2.9 that are multiply-imaged in the optical/NIR observations. However, the dramatic resolution difference between the sub-mm map and the optical/NIR images make it difficult to confirm this hypothesis. Aims: In a previous paper, we reported the detection of 1.4 GHz continuum radio emission coincident with this sub-mm source using VLA archival data. To fully understand the relation between this radio emission, the sub-mm emission, and the optical/IR multiplyimaged sources, we have re-observed the cluster with the VLA at higher resolution. Methods: The previous archival data has been re-reduced and combined with the new observations to produced a deep ({$\sim$}10 {$\mu$}Jy beam -1), high resolution ({$\sim$}2{${''}$}) map centred on the cluster core. The strong lensing effect in the radio data has been quantified by constructing a new lens model of the cluster. Results: From the high resolution map we have robustly identified six radio sources located within SMM J 04542-0301. The brightest and most extended of these sources (RJ) is located in the middle of the sub-mm emission, and has no obvious counterpart in the optical/ NIR. Three other detections (E1, E2 and E3) seem to be associated with the images of one of the EROs (B), although the NIR and radio emission appear to originate at slightly different positions in the source plane. The last two detections (CR1 and CR2), for which no optical/NIR counterpart have been found, seem to constitute two relatively compact emitting regions embedded in a {$\sim$}5{${''}$} extended radio source located at the position of the sub-mm peak. The presence of this extended component (which contributes 38\% of the total radio flux in this region) can only be explained if it is being produced by a lensed region of dust obscured star formation in the center of the merger. A comparison between the radio and sub-mm data at the same resolution suggests that E1, E2, E3, CR1 and CR2 are associated with the sub-mm emission. Conclusions: The radio observations presented in this paper provide strong observational evidence in favour of the merger hypothesis. However, the question if RJ is also contributing to the observed sub-mm emission remains open. These results illustrate the promising prospects for radio interferometry and strong gravitational lensing to study the internal structure of SMGs. \textcopyright{} 2010 ESO.},

In contrast with standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, it generates nonlocal, nonsymmetric moves in the state space, alleviating random walk type behaviour for the simulated trajectories. However, similarly to algorithms based on random walk or Langevin proposals, the number of steps required to explore the target distribution typically grows with the dimension of the state space. We define a generalized HMC algorithm which overcomes this problem for target measures arising as finite-dimensional approximations of measures {$\pi$} which have density with respect to a Gaussian measure on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The key idea is to construct an MCMC method which is well defined on the Hilbert space itself.},

Here, we study the effects of this new model in massive, gas-rich galaxies with several simulations of different feedback recipes with the hydrodynamics code RAMSES. These simulations are compared to a reference simulation without any feedback, in which the cooling halo gas is quickly consumed in a burst of star formation. In the presence of strong supernovae (SN) feedback, we observe the formation of a galactic fountain that regulates star formation over a longer period, but without halting it. If only AGN feedback is considered, as soon as the SMBH reaches a critical mass, strong outflows of hot gas are launched and prevent the cooling halo gas from reaching the disc, thus efficiently halting star formation, leading to the so-called 'quenching'. If both feedback mechanisms act in tandem, we observe a non-linear coupling, in the sense that the dense gas in the supernovae-powered galactic fountain is propelled by the hot outflow powered by the AGN at much larger radii than without AGN. We argue that these particular outflows are able to unbind dense gas from the galactic halo, thanks to the combined effect of SN and AGN feedback. We speculate that this mechanism occurs at the end of the fast growing phase of SMBH, and is at the origin of the dense molecular outflows observed in many massive high-redshift galaxies.},

We have measured the anisotropy \$\textbackslash beta\$ as a function of Galactocentric radius from \$5-100\$ kpc for over 8600 metal poor ([Fe/H] \${$<$}-1.3\$) halo K giants from the LAMOST catalog with line-of-sight velocities and distances, matched to proper motions from the second \$Gaia\$ data release. We construct full 6-D positions and velocities for the K giants to directly measure the 3 components of the velocity dispersion \$(\textbackslash sigma\_r, \textbackslash sigma\_\textbackslash theta, \textbackslash sigma\_\textbackslash phi)\$ (in spherical coordinates). We find that the orbits in the halo are radial over our full Galactocentric distance range reaching over 100 kpc. The anisotropy remains remarkably unchanged with Galactocentric radius from approximately 5 to 25 kpc, with an amplitude that depends on the metallicity of the stars, dropping from \$\textbackslash beta \textbackslash approx 0.9\$ for \$-1.8 \textbackslash leq\$ [Fe/H] \${$<$} -1.3\$ (for the bulk of the stars) to \$\textbackslash beta \textbackslash approx 0.6\$ for the lowest metallicities ([Fe/H] \${$<$} -1.8\$). Considering our sample as a whole, \$\textbackslash beta\textbackslash approx0.8\$ and, beyond 25 kpc, the orbits gradually become less radial and anisotropy decreases to \$\textbackslash beta{$<$}0.3\$ past 100 kpc. Within 8 kpc, \$\textbackslash beta{$<$}0.8\$. The measurement of anisotropy is affected by substructure and streams, particularly beyond a Galactocentric distance of approximately 25 kpc, where the Sagittarius stream is prominent in the data. These results are complimentary to recent analysis of simulations by Loebman et al. and of SDSS/\$Gaia\$ DR1 data by Belokurov et al.},

  abstract = {Kinematic studies of disc galaxies, using individual stars in the Milky Way or statistical studies of global disc kinematics over time, provide insight into how discs form and evolve. We use a high-resolution, cosmological zoom-simulation of a Milky Way-mass disc galaxy (h277) to tie together local disc kinematics and the evolution of the disc over time. The present-day stellar age\textendash velocity relationship (AVR) of h277 is nearly identical to that of the analogous solar-neighbourhood measurement in the Milky Way. A crucial element of this success is the simulation's dynamically cold multiphase ISM, which allows young stars to form with a low velocity dispersion ({$\sigma$} birth{$\sim$} 6 - 8 km s-1) at late times. Older stars are born kinematically hotter (i.e. the disc settles over time in an `upside-down' formation scenario), and are subsequently heated after birth. The disc also grows `inside-out', and many of the older stars in the present-day solar neighbourhood are present because of radial mixing. We demonstrate that the evolution of {$\sigma$} birth in h277 can be explained by the same model used to describe the general decrease in velocity dispersion observed in disc galaxies from z {$\sim$} 2\textendash 3 to the present-day, in which the disc evolves in quasi-stable equilibrium and the ISM velocity dispersion decreases over time due to a decreasing gas fraction. Thus, our results tie together local observations of the Milky Way's AVR with observed kinematics of high z disc galaxies.},

In this article, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find a member of that family which is close to the target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback\textendash Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this article is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

  abstract = {CO line emission represents the most accessible and widely used tracer of the molecular interstellar medium. This renders the translation of observed CO intensity into total H2 gas mass critical to understand star formation and the interstellar medium in our Galaxy and beyond. We review the theoretical underpinning, techniques, and results of efforts to estimate this CO-to-H2 "conversion factor," Xco, in different environments. In the Milky Way disk, we recommend a conversion factor Xco = 2x10\^\{20\} cm\^-2/(K km/s)\^-1 with +/-30\% uncertainty. Studies of other "normal galaxies" return similar values in Milky Way-like disks, but with greater scatter and systematic uncertainty. Departures from this Galactic conversion factor are both observed and expected. Dust-based determinations, theoretical arguments, and scaling relations all suggest that Xco increases with decreasing metallicity, turning up sharply below metallicity \textasciitilde 1/3-1/2 solar in a manner consistent with model predictions that identify shielding as a key parameter. Based on spectral line modeling and dust observations, Xco appears to drop in the central, bright regions of some but not all galaxies, often coincident with regions of bright CO emission and high stellar surface density. This lower Xco is also present in the overwhelmingly molecular interstellar medium of starburst galaxies, where several lines of evidence point to a lower CO-to-H2 conversion factor. At high redshift, direct evidence regarding the conversion factor remains scarce; we review what is known based on dynamical modeling and other arguments.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We detect 12CO emission in 32 SMGs at z \textasciitilde{} 1.2-4.1, including 16 SMGs not previously published. Using multiple 12CO line (Jup = 2-7) observations, we derive a median spectral line energy distribution for luminous SMGs. We report the discovery of a fundamental relationship between 12CO FWHM and 12CO line luminosity in high-redshift starbursts, which we interpret as a natural consequence of the baryon-dominated dynamics within the regions probed by our observations. We use far-infrared luminosities to assess the star formation efficiency in our SMGs, finding that the slope of the L' CO -LFIR relation is close to linear. We derive molecular gas masses, finding a mean gas mass of (5.3 {$\pm$} 1.0) \texttimes{} 10)10 M{$\odot$}. Combining these with dynamical masses, we determine the redshift evolution of the gas content of SMGs, finding that they do not appear to be significantly more gas rich than less vigorously star-forming galaxies at high redshifts. Finally, we collate X-ray observations, and study the interdependence of gas and dynamical properties of SMGs with their AGN activity and supermassive black holemasses (MBH), finding that SMGs lie significantly below the local MBH-{$\sigma$} relation. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.

Through case studies on text classification and the training of deep neural networks, we discuss how optimization problems arise in machine learning and what makes them challenging. A major theme of our study is that large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter. Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior, and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance. This leads to a discussion about the next generation of optimization methods for large-scale machine learning, including an investigation of two main streams of research on techniques that diminish noise in the stochastic directions and methods that make use of second-order derivative approximations.},

We show that at least two (and typically four) of these massive dark subhaloes are expected to produce a larger dark matter annihilation flux than Draco. It may be possible to circumvent these conclusions if baryonic feedback in dwarf satellites or different dark matter physics can reduce the central densities of massive subhaloes by order unity on a scale of 0.3-1 kpc. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society \textcopyright{} 2011 RAS.},

Despite Leo I's large Galactocentric space velocity (200 km s-1) and distance (261 kpc), we show that it is extremely unlikely to be unbound if Galactic satellites are associated with dark matter substructure, as 99.9\% of subhalos in the simulations are bound to their host. The observed position and velocity of Leo I strongly disfavor a low-mass Milky Way: if we assume that Leo I is the least bound of the Milky Way's classical satellites, then we find that Mvir, MW {$>$} 1012 M {$\cdot$} at 95\% confidence for a variety of Bayesian priors on M vir, MW. In lower mass halos, it is vanishingly rare to find subhalos at 261 kpc moving as fast as Leo I. Should an additional classical satellite be found to be less bound than Leo I, this lower limit on Mvir, MW would increase by 30\%. Imposing a mass-weighted {$\Lambda$}CDM prior, we find a median Milky Way virial mass of Mvir, MW = 1.6 \texttimes{} 10 12 M{$\cdot$}, with a 90\% confidence interval of [1.0-2.4] \texttimes{} 1012 M{$\cdot$}.

  abstract = {Differential Evolution (DE) is a simple genetic algorithm for numerical optimization in real parameter spaces. In a statistical context one would not just want the optimum but also its uncertainty. The uncertainty distribution can be obtained by a Bayesian analysis (after specifying prior and likelihood) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. This paper integrates the essential ideas of DE and MCMC, resulting in Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC). DE-MC is a population MCMC algorithm, in which multiple chains are run in parallel. DE-MC solves an important problem in MCMC, namely that of choosing an appropriate scale and orientation for the jumping distribution. In DE-MC the jumps are simply a fixed multiple of the differences of two random parameter vectors that are currently in the population. The selection process of DE-MC works via the usual Metropolis ratio which defines the probability with which a proposal is accepted. In tests with known uncertainty distributions, the efficiency of DE-MC with respect to random walk Metropolis with optimal multivariate Normal jumps ranged from 68\% for small population sizes to 100\% for large population sizes and even to 500\% for the 97.5\% point of a variable from a 50-dimensional Student distribution. Two Bayesian examples illustrate the potential of DE-MC in practice. DE-MC is shown to facilitate multidimensional updates in a multi-chain ``Metropolis-withinGibbs'' sampling approach. The advantage of DE-MC over conventional MCMC are simplicity, speed of calculation and convergence, even for nearly collinear parameters and multimodal densities.},

  abstract = {The politics of global energy are subject to increasing academic interest. Most work on energy politics focuses on oil, based upon a normative vision of a global energy modernity of fossil fuels and a transition to renewables. In many African countries, however, the most prevalent source of energy is not oil, but woodfuel. Charcoal is of particular importance due to its centrality to urbanization: charcoal is the primary household energy source for up to 80\% of urban Africa, and its consumption is expected to continue increasing with expanding urbanization. Despite this centrality, the politics of charcoal remain largely unexplored. This article asks how political power shapes charcoal production and how charcoal as an energy source shapes political power through an in-depth study of charcoal extraction in northern Uganda. It argues that charcoal production, and its particular destructiveness, should be understood as a continuation of the violence of the 1986\textendash 2006 war between the Lord's Resistance Army and the Ugandan government. Based on long-term fieldwork in northern Uganda, the article draws a distinction between the politics of small-scale household production and of large-scale industrial production. By focusing on the political violence of industrial charcoal production, we argue that orthodox academic and policy narratives about the charcoal industry in Africa can be qualified, and new questions can be raised concerning broader narratives of energy modernity and global energy politics.},

  abstract = {If an extended source, such as a galaxy, is gravitationally lensed by a massive object in the foreground, the lensing distorts the observed image. It is straightforward to simulate what the observed image would be for a particular lens and source combination. In practice, one observes the lensed image on the sky, but blurred by atmospheric and telescopic effects and also contaminated with noise. The question that then arises is, given this incomplete data, what combinations of lens mass distribution and source surface brightness profile could plausibly have produced this image? This is a classic example of an inverse problem, and the method for solving it is given by the framework of Bayesian inference. In this paper we demonstrate the application of Bayesian inference to the problem of gravitational lens reconstruction, and illustrate the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations which can be used when the analytical calculations become too difficult. Previous methods for performing gravitational lens inversion are seen in a new light, as special cases of the general approach presented in this paper. Thus, we are able to answer, at least in principle, lingering questions about the uncertainties in the reconstructed source and lens parameters, taking into account all of the data and any prior information we may have.},

We find that the analytic formulae provide a good description of the relations between three of the four numerical quantities. The fourth (luminosity) also agrees once we introduce a procedure to correct for the fixed numerical resolution. We also compute the normalizations for the virial relations and compare extensively to the existing literature, finding remarkably good agreement. The Press-Schechter prescription is calibrated with the simulations, again finding results consistent with other authors. We also examine related issues such as the size of the scatter in the virial relations, the effect of metallicity with a fixed pass-band, and the structure of the halos. All of this is done in order to establish a firm groundwork for the use of clusters as cosmological probes. Implications for the models are briefly discussed.},

We break spectroscopic degeneracies in our spectrum analysis with astrometry from Gaia DR2 and photometry from 2MASS. We report abundance ratios [X/Fe] for 30 different elements (11 of which are based on non-LTE computations) covering five nucleosynthetic pathways. We describe validations for accuracy and precision, flagging of peculiar stars/measurements and recommendations for using our results. Our catalogue comprises 65 per cent dwarfs, 34 per cent giants, and 1 per cent other/unclassified stars.

  abstract = {The dark energy plus cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmological model has been a demonstrably successful framework for predicting and explaining the large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution with time. Yet on length scales smaller than {$\sim$}1 Mpc and mass scales smaller than {$\sim$}1011Mo, the theory faces a number of challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark matter-dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than na\"ively predicted in {$\Lambda$}CDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with {$\Lambda$}CDM: cusp/core, missing satellites, and too-big-to-fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both is required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of {$\Lambda$}CDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over the next decade. These efforts will either further verify the {$\Lambda$}CDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

Taking a rate-distortion theory perspective, we show the circumstances under which representations aligned with the underlying generative factors of variation of data emerge when optimising the modified ELBO bound in-VAE, as training progresses. From these insights, we propose a modification to the training regime of-VAE, that progressively increases the information capacity of the latent code during training. This modification facilitates the robust learning of disentangled representations in-VAE, without the previous trade-off in reconstruction accuracy.},

  abstract = {We present and apply a method to infer the mass of the Milky Way (MW) by comparing the dynamics of MW satellites to those of model satellites in the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. A distribution function (DF) for galactic satellites is constructed from EAGLE using specific angular momentum and specific energy, which are scaled so as to be independent of host halo mass. In this two-dimensional space, the orbital properties of satellite galaxies vary according to the host halo mass. The halo mass can be inferred by calculating the likelihood that the observed satellite population is drawn from this DF. Our method is robustly calibrated on mock EAGLE systems. We validate it by applying it to the completely independent suite of 30 AURIGA high-resolution simulations of MW-like galaxies: the method accurately recovers their true mass and associated uncertainties. We then apply it to 10 classical satellites of the MW with six-dimensional phase-space measurements, including updated proper motions from the Gaia satellite. The mass of the MW is estimated to be M200MW = 1.17+0.21-0.15 \texttimes{} 1012 M (68 per cent confidence limits). We combine our total mass estimate with recent mass estimates in the inner regions of the Galaxy to infer an inner dark matter (DM) mass fraction MDM({$<$} 20 kpc)/MDM200 = 0.12, which is typical of {$\sim$}1012 M lambda cold dark matter haloes in hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations. Assuming a Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) profile, this is equivalent to a halo concentration of c200MW = 10.9+2.6-2.0},

We find a tight correlation of the form (M/L)=(3.80+/-0.14)*(sigma/200 km/s)\^(0.84+/-0.07) between the dynamical M/L (in the I-band) and the luminosity-weighted second moment (sigma) of the line-of-sight velocity-distribution within Re.

The (M/L)-sigma relation can be included in the remarkable series of tight correlations between sigma and other galaxy global observables. The comparison of the observed correlations with the predictions of the Fundamental Plane (FP), and with simple virial estimates, shows that the `tilt' of the FP of early-type galaxies, is due to a real M/L variation, while structural and orbital non-homology have a negligible effect. The virial mass is a reliable estimator of the mass in the central regions of galaxies. The best-fitting virial relation has the form (M/L)\_vir=(5.0+/-0.1)*Re*sigma\^2/(L*G). The comparison of the dynamical M/L with the (M/L)\_pop inferred from the analysis of the stellar population, indicates a median dark matter fraction in early-type galaxies of \textasciitilde 30\% of the total mass inside one Re.

This approach enables the measurement of spectrophotometric distances, in addition to stellar parameters such as Teff, logg, [Fe/H], [{$\alpha$}/Fe], and radial velocity. MINESweeper employs a Bayesian framework and can easily incorporate a variety of priors, including Gaia parallaxes. Mock data are fit in order to demonstrate how the precision of derived parameters depends on evolutionary phase and SNR. We then fit a selection of data in order to validate the model outputs. Fits to the benchmark stars Procyon, Arcturus, and the Sun result in derived stellar parameters that are in excellent agreement with the literature, except for the surface gravity of Arcturus, where our value (1.35) is notably lower than the literature (1.66). We then fit combined spectra and photometry of stars in the open and globular clusters M92, M13, M3, M107, M71, and M67. Derived distances, [Fe/H], [{$\alpha$}/Fe], and logg-Teffrelations are in overall good agreement with literature values, although there are trends between metallicity and logg within clusters that point to systematic uncertainties at the {$\approx$} 0:1 dex level. Finally, we fit a large sample of stars from the H3 Spectroscopic Survey in which high quality Gaia parallaxes are also available. These stars are fit without the Gaia parallaxes so that the geometric parallaxes can serve as an independent test of the spectrophotometric distances. Comparison between the two reveals excellent agreement within their formal uncertainties after accounting for the Gaia zero point uncertainties.},

GN20 is one of the most luminous starburst galaxy known at z {$>$} 4, and is a member of a rich proto-cluster of galaxies at z = 4.05 in GOODS-North. We have observed the CO 1-0 and 2-1 emission with the VLA, the CO 6-5 emission with the PdBI Interferometer, and the 5-4 emission with CARMA. The H\_2 mass derived from the CO 1-0 emission is 1.3 \textbackslash times 10\^\{11\} (\textbackslash alpha/0.8) Mo. High resolution imaging of CO 2-1 shows emission distributed over a large area, appearing as partial ring, or disk, of \textasciitilde{} 10kpc diameter. The integrated CO excitation is higher than found in the inner disk of the Milky Way, but lower than that seen in high redshift quasar host galaxies and low redshift starburst nuclei. The VLA CO 2-1 image at 0.2" resolution shows resolved, clumpy structure, with a few brighter clumps with intrinsic sizes \textasciitilde{} 2 kpc. The velocity field determined from the CO 6-5 emission is consistent with a rotating disk with a rotation velocity of \textasciitilde{} 570 km s\^\{-1\} (using an inclination angle of 45\^o), from which we derive a dynamical mass of 3 \textbackslash times 10\^\{11\} \textbackslash msun within about 4 kpc radius. The star formation distribution, as derived from imaging of the radio synchrotron and dust continuum, is on a similar scale as the molecular gas distribution. The molecular gas and star formation are offset by \textasciitilde{} 1" from the HST I-band emission, implying that the regions of most intense star formation are highly dust-obscured on a scale of \textasciitilde{} 10 kpc. The large spatial extent and ordered rotation of this object suggests that this is not a major merger, but rather a clumpy disk accreting gas rapidly in minor mergers or smoothly from the proto-intracluster medium.

  abstract = {Over the last decade, observations of the cool interstellar medium in distant galaxies via molecular and atomic fine structure line emission has gone from a curious look into a few extreme, rare objects, to a mainstream tool to study galaxy formation, out to the highest redshifts. Molecular gas has now been observed in close to 200 galaxies at z{$>$}1, including numerous AGN host-galaxies out to z\textasciitilde 7, highly starforming sub-millimeter galaxies (median redshift z\textasciitilde 2.5), and increasing samples of 'main-sequence' star forming galaxies at z\textasciitilde 1.5-2.5. Studies have moved well beyond simple detections, to dynamical imaging at kpc-scale resolution, and multi-line, multi-species studies that determine the physical conditions in the interstellar medium. Observations of the cool gas are the required complement to studies of the stellar density and star formation history of the Universe, as they reveal the phase of the interstellar medium that immediately precedes star formation. Current observations suggest that the order of magnitude increase in the cosmic star formation rate density from z\textasciitilde 0 to 2 is commensurate with a similar increase in the gas to stellar mass ratio in star forming disk galaxies. Progress has been made on determining the CO luminosity to H\_2 mass conversion factor at high-z, and the dichotomy between high versus low depletion time values for main sequence versus starburst galaxies, respectively, with a likely dependence on metallicity and other local physical conditions. Studies of atomic fine structure line emission are rapidly progressing, with some tens of galaxies detected in the exceptionally bright [CII] 158 micron line to date. This line is proving to be a unique tracer of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe and has the potential to be the most direct means of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for the first galaxies during cosmic reionization.},

Previous [Oiii]{$\lambda$}5007 observations of these quasars showed evidence for ionised outflows quenching star formation in their host galaxies. Systemic CO(3-2) emission has been detected only in one quasar, LBQS 0109+0213, where the CO(3-2) emission is spatially anti-correlated with the ionised outflow, suggesting that most of the molecular gas may have been dispersed or heated in the region swept by the outflow. In all three sources, including the one detected in CO, our constraints on the molecular gas mass indicate a significantly reduced reservoir compared to main-sequence galaxies at the same redshift, supporting a negative feedback scenario. In the quasar 2QZ J002830.4-281706, we tentatively detect an emission line blob blue-shifted by v {$\sim$} - 2000 km s-1 with respect to the galaxy systemic velocity and spatially offset by 0.2{${'}{'}$} (1.7 kpc) with respect to the ALMA continuum peak. Interestingly, such emission feature is coincident in both velocity and space with the ionised outflow as seen in [Oiii]{$\lambda$}5007. This tentative detection must be confirmed with deeper observations but, if real, it could represent the molecular counterpart of the ionised gas outflow driven by the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Finally, in all ALMA maps we detect the presence of serendipitous line emitters within a projected distance {$\sim$}160 kpc from the quasars. By identifying these features with the CO(3-2) transition, we find that the serendipitous line emitters would be located within | {$\Delta$}v | {$<$} 500 km s-1 from the quasars, hence suggesting an overdensity of galaxies in two out of three quasars.},

Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration.

Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package.

We combine data from the H3 Spectroscopic Survey and Gaia to measure metallicities, abundances of {$\alpha$} elements, stellar ages, and orbital properties of a sample of 482 very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H]{$<$} -2) stars in order to constrain their origins. This sample is confined to 1 . |Z| . 3 kpc from the Galactic plane. We find that {$>$} 70\% of VMP stars near the disk are on prograde orbits and this fraction increases toward lower metallicities. This result unexpected if metal-poor stars are predominantly accreted from many small systems with no preferred orientation, as such a scenario would imply a mostly isotropic distribution. Furthermore, we find there is some evidence for higher fractions of prograde orbits amongst stars with lower [{$\alpha$}/Fe]. Isochrone-based ages for main sequence turn-off stars reveal that these VMP stars are uniformly old ({$\approx$} 12 Gyr) irrespective of the {$\alpha$} abundance and metallicity, suggesting that the metal-poor population was not born from the same well-mixed gas disk. We speculate that the VMP population has a heterogeneous origin, including both in-situ formation in the ancient disk and accretion from a satellite with the same direction of rotation as the ancient disk at early times. Our precisely measured ages for these VMP stars on prograde orbits show that the Galaxy has had a relatively quiescent merging history over most of cosmic time, and implies the angular momentum alignment of the Galaxy has been in place for at least 12 Gyr.},

This sample is among the largest samples of OCs homogeneously characterized in terms of atmospheric parameters, detailed chemistry, and age. Results. In our metallicity range (-0.2 {$<$} [M/H] {$<$} +0.2) we find that while most Fe-peak and {$\alpha$} elements show a flat dependence on age, the s-process elements show a decreasing trend with increasing age with a remarkable knee at 1 Gyr. For Ba, Ce, Y, Mo, and Zr, we find a plateau at young ages ({$<$}1 Gyr). We investigate the relations between all possible combinations among the computed chemical species and age. We find 19 combinations with significant slopes, including [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al]. The ratio [Ba/{$\alpha$}] shows the most significant correlation. Conclusions. We find that the [Y/Mg] relation found in the literature using solar twins is compatible with the one found here in the solar neighborhood. The age\textendash abundance relations in clusters at large distances(d {$>$} 1 kpc) show larger scatter than those in clusters in the solar neighborhood, particularly in the outer disk.

When summed up, all of the dusty, star-forming galaxies in the Universe produce an infrared radiation field that has an equal energy density as the direct starlight emission from all galaxies visible at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. The bulk of this infrared extragalactic background light emanates from galaxies as diverse as gas-rich disks to mergers of intense starbursting galaxies. Major advances in far-infrared instrumentation in recent years, both space-based and ground-based, has led to the detection of nearly a million DSFGs, yet our understanding of the underlying astrophysics that govern the start and end of the dusty starburst phase is still in nascent stage. This review is aimed at summarizing the current status of DSFG studies, focusing especially on the detailed characterization of the best-understood subset (submillimeter galaxies, who were summarized in the last review of this field over a decade ago, Blain et al., 2002), but also the selection and characterization of more recently discovered DSFG populations. We review DSFG population statistics, their physical properties including dust, gas and stellar contents, their environments, and current theoretical models related to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms governing the stellar mass assembly and star formation history of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are still being debated. By means of new and archival molecular gas observations we investigate the role of dense megaparsec-scale environments in regulating the fueling of star formation in distant BCGs, through cosmic time. We observed in CO with the IRAM 30 m telescope two star-forming BCGs belonging to SpARCS clusters, namely, 3C 244.1 ( z = 0.4) and SDSS J161112.65+550823.5 ( z = 0.9), and compared their molecular gas and star formation properties with those of a compilation of {$\sim$}100 distant cluster galaxies from the literature, including nine additional distant BCGs at z {$\sim$} 0.4 - 3.5. We set robust upper limits of M  H 2  {$<$} 1.0 \texttimes{} 10 10 M {$\odot$} and {$<$} 2.8 \texttimes{} 10 10 M {$\odot$} to their molecular gas content, respectively, and to the ratio of molecular gas to stellar mass M (H 2 )/ M {$\star$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.2 and depletion time {$\tau$} dep {$\lessequivlnt$} 40 Myr of the two targeted BCGs. They are thus among the distant cluster galaxies with the lowest gas fractions and shortest depletion times. The majority (64\%{$\pm$}15\% and 73\%{$\pm$}18\%) of the 11 BCGs with observations in CO have lower M (H 2 )/ M {$\star$} values and {$\tau$} dep , respectively, than those estimated for main sequence galaxies. Statistical analysis also tentatively suggests that the values of M (H 2 )/ M {$\star$} and {$\tau$} dep for the 11 BCGs deviates, with a significance of {$\sim$}2 {$\sigma$} , from those of the comparison sample of cluster galaxies. A morphological analysis for a subsample of seven BCGs with archival HST observations reveals that 71\%{$\pm$}17\% of the BCGs are compact or show star-forming components or substructures. Our results suggest a scenario where distant star-forming BCGs assemble a significant fraction {$\sim$}16\% of their stellar mass on the relatively short timescale {$\sim$} {$\tau$} dep , while environmental mechanisms might prevent the replenishment of gas feeding the star formation. We speculate that compact components also favor the rapid exhaustion of molecular gas and ultimately help to quench the BCGs. Distant star-forming BCGs are excellent targets for ALMA and for next-generation telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope.},

  abstract = {Methods. We used the OCfinder method to search for new open clusters in Gaia EDR3 using a big data environment. As a first step, OCfinder identified stellar statistical overdensities in five-dimensional astrometric space (position, parallax, and proper motions) using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. Then, these overdensities were classified into random statistical overdensities or real physical open clusters using a deep artificial neural network trained on well-characterised G, GBP - GRP colour-magnitude diagrams. Results. We report the discovery of 628 new open clusters within the Galactic disc, with most of them being located beyond 1 kpc from the Sun. From the estimation of ages, distances, and line-of-sight extinctions of these open clusters, we see that young clusters align following the Galactic spiral arms while older ones are dispersed in the Galactic disc. Furthermore, we find that most open clusters are located at low Galactic altitudes with the exception of a few groups older than 1 Gyr. Conclusions. We show the success of the OCfinder method leading to the discovery of a total of 1274 open clusters (joining the discoveries here with the previous ones based on Gaia DR2), which represents almost 50\% of the known population. Our ability to perform big data searches on a large volume of the Galactic disc, together with the higher precision in Gaia EDR3, enable us to keep completing the census with the discovery of new open clusters.},

Using various hydrodynamical simulations of MW-mass haloes, we show that the presence of baryons induces a contraction of the dark matter (DM) distribution in the inner regions, r {$\lessequivlnt$} 20 kpc. We provide an analytic expression that relates the baryonic distribution to the change in the DM halo profile. For our galaxy, the contraction increases the enclosed DM halo mass by factors of roughly 1.3, 2, and 4 at radial distances of 20, 8, and 1 kpc, respectively compared to an uncontracted halo. Ignoring this contraction results in systematic biases in the inferred halo mass and concentration. We provide a best-fitting contracted NFW halo model to the MW rotation curve that matches the data very well.1 The best-fit has a DM halo mass, \$M\_\{200\}\^\{\textbackslash rm DM\}=0.97\_\{-0.19\}\^\{+0.24\}\textbackslash times 10\^\{12\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$, and concentration before baryon contraction of \$9.4\_\{-2.6\}\^\{+1.9\}\$, which lie close to the median halo mass\textendash concentration relation predicted in {$\Lambda$}CDM.

As a general feature, the IMF is well described by a power-law form for \$m\textbackslash ga 1 \textbackslash msol\$ and a lognormal form below. The extension of the disk IMF into the brown dwarf (BD) regime is in good agreement with observations and yields a disk BD number-density comparable to the stellar one \$\textbackslash sim 0.1 \textbackslash pc3\$. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. Within all the uncertainties, it is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters, and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk. The IMF characteristic of early star formation remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \$\textbackslash sim 1 \textbackslash msol\$. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The M/L ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8 and 1.4 smaller than a Salpeter IMF, respectively. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. (shortened)},

InfoGAN is a generative adversarial network that also maximizes the mutual information between a small subset of the latent variables and the observation. We derive a lower bound of the mutual information objective that can be optimized efficiently. Specifically, InfoGAN successfully disentangles writing styles from digit shapes on the MNIST dataset, pose from lighting of 3D rendered images, and background digits from the central digit on the SVHN dataset. It also discovers visual concepts that include hair styles, presence/absence of eyeglasses, and emotions on the CelebA face dataset. Experiments show that InfoGAN learns interpretable representations that are competitive with representations learned by existing supervised methods.

While the manifold hypothesis im-plies that a dataset contains large regions of low density, the training criterions of VAEs and GANs will make the latent space densely covered. Consequently points that are sep-arated by low-density regions in observation space will be pushed together in latent space, making stationary distances poor proxies for similarity. We transfer ideas from Rieman-nian geometry to this setting, letting the distance between two points be the short-est path on a Riemannian manifold induced by the transformation. The method yields a principled distance measure, provides a tool for visual inspection of deep generative models, and an alternative to linear interpolation in latent space. In addition, it can be applied for robot movement generalization us-ing previously learned skills. The method is evaluated on a synthetic dataset with known ground truth; on a simulated robot arm dataset; on human motion capture data; and on a generative model of handwritten digits.},

  abstract = {We study the properties of massive, galactic-scale outflows of molecular gas and investigate their impact on galaxy evolution. We present new IRAM PdBI CO(1-0) observations of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and quasar-hosts: a clear signature of massive and energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in the CO(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates of several 100 M yr-1. We combine these new observations with data from the literature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflows within an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. We find that starburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their star formation rate (SFR), or even higher by a factor of \textasciitilde 2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed be effective in removing cold gas from galaxies. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, which is found to increase with the LAGN/Lbol ratio. The gas depletion time scales due to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosity of an AGN in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years in starburst galaxies down to just a few million years in galaxies hosting powerful AGNs. In quasar hosts, the depletion time scales due to the outflow are much shorter than the depletion time scales due to star formation. We estimate the outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful AGNs, it corresponds to about 5\% of the AGN luminosity, as expected by models of AGN feedback. Moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 LAGN/c are common among the AGN-dominated sources in our sample. For "pure" starburst galaxies, our data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostly momentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds. Overall, our results indicate that, although starbursts are effective in powering massive molecular outflows, the presence of an AGN may strongly enhance such outflows, and therefore have a profound feedback effect on the evolution of galaxies by efficiently removing fuel for star formation, hence quenching star formation. \textcopyright{} ESO, 2014.},

  abstract = {We serendipitously discovered in the Herschel Reference Survey an extremely bright infrared source with S 500 {$\sim$} 120 mJy in the line of sight of the Virgo cluster which we name Red Virgo 4 (RV4). Based on IRAM/EMIR and IRAM/NOEMA detections of the CO(5-4), CO(4-3), and [CI] lines, RV4 is located at a redshift of 4.724, yielding a total observed infrared luminosity of 1.1 {$\pm$} 0.6 \texttimes{} 10 14 L {$\odot$} . At the position of the Herschel emission, three blobs are detected with the VLA at 10 cm. The CO(5-4) line detection of each blob confirms that they are at the same redshift with the same line width, indicating that they are multiple images of the same source. In Spitzer and deep optical observations, two sources, High- z Lens 1 (HL1) West and HL1 East, are detected at the center of the three VLA/NOEMA blobs. These two sources are placed at z = 1.48 with X-shooter spectra, suggesting that they could be merging and gravitationally lensing the emission of RV4. HL1 is the second most distant lens known to date in strong lensing systems. Constrained by the position of the three VLA/NOEMA blobs, the Einstein radius of the lensing system is 2.2{${''}$} {$\pm$} 0.2 (20 kpc). The high redshift of HL1 and the large Einstein radius are highly unusual for a strong lensing system. In this paper, we present the insterstellar medium properties of the background source RV4. Different estimates of the gas depletion time yield low values suggesting that RV4 is a starburst galaxy. Among all high- z submillimeter galaxies, this source exhibits one of the lowest L [CI] to L IR ratios, 3.2 {$\pm$} 0.9 \texttimes{} 10 -6 , suggesting an extremely short gas depletion time of only 14 {$\pm$} 5 Myr. It also shows a relatively high L [CI] to L CO(4-3) ratio (0.7 {$\pm$} 0.2) and low L CO(5-4) to L IR ratio (only {$\sim$}50\% of the value expected for normal galaxies) hinting at low density of gas. Finally, we discuss the short depletion time of RV4. It can be explained by either a very high star formation efficiency, which is difficult to reconcile with major mergers simulations of high- z galaxies, or a rapid decrease of star formation, which would bias the estimate of the depletion time toward an artificially low value.},

  abstract = {We develop a Bayesian Machine Learning framework called BINGO (Bayesian INference for Galactic archaeOlogy) centred around a Bayesian neural network. After being trained on the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and Kepler asteroseismic age data, BINGO is used to obtain precise relative stellar age estimates with uncertainties for the APOGEE stars. We carefully construct a training set to minimize bias and apply BINGO to a stellar population that is similar to our training set. We then select the 17 305 stars with ages from BINGO and reliable kinematic properties obtained from Gaia DR2. By combining the age and chemo-kinematical information, we dissect the Galactic disc stars into three components, namely the thick disc (old, high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe], [{$\alpha$}/Fe] 0.12), the thin disc (young, low-[{$\alpha$}/Fe]), and the Bridge, which is a region between the thick and thin discs. Our results indicate that the thick disc formed at an early epoch only in the inner region, and the inner disc smoothly transforms to the thin disc. We found that the outer disc follows a different chemical evolution pathway from the inner disc. The outer metal-poor stars only start forming after the compact thick disc phase has completed and the star-forming gas disc extended outwardly with metal-poor gas accretion. We found that in the Bridge region the range of [Fe/H] becomes wider with decreasing age, which suggests that the Bridge region corresponds to the transition phase from the smaller chemically well-mixed thick to a larger thin disc with a metallicity gradient.},

  abstract = {We use models of stellar angular momentum evolution to determine ages for {$\sim$}500 stars in the APOGEE-Kepler Cool Dwarfs sample. We focus on lower-main-sequence stars, where other age-dating tools become ineffective. Our age distributions are compared to those derived from asteroseismic and giant samples and solar analogs. We are able to recover gyrochronological ages for old, lower-main-sequence stars, a remarkable improvement over prior work in hotter stars. Under our model assumptions, our ages have a median relative uncertainty of 14\%, comparable to the age precision inferred for more massive stars using traditional methods. We investigate trends of Galactic {$\alpha$}-enhancement with age, finding evidence of a detection threshold between the age of the oldest {$\alpha$}-poor stars and that of the bulk {$\alpha$}-rich population. We argue that gyrochronology is an effective tool reaching ages of 10\textendash 12 Gyr in K and early M dwarfs. Finally, we present the first effort to quantify the impact of detailed abundance patterns on rotational evolution. We estimate a {$\sim$}15\% bias in age for cool, {$\alpha$}-enhanced (+0.4 dex) stars when standard solar-abundance-pattern rotational models are used for age inference, rather than models that appropriately account for {$\alpha$}-enrichment.},

This is because they are easy to find in the light curve databases of large stellar surveys and their distances can be determined with only knowledge of the light curve. We present here a sample of 112 RR Lyr beyond 50 kpc in the outer halo of the Milky Way, excluding the Sgr streams, for which we have obtained moderate resolution spectra with Deimos on the Keck 2 Telescope. Four of these have distances exceeding 100 kpc. These were selected from a much larger set of 447 candidate RR Lyr which were datamined using machine learning techniques applied to the light curves of variable stars in the Palomar Transient Facility database. The observed radial velocities taken at the phase of the variable corresponding to the time of observation were converted to systemic radial velocities in the Galactic standard of rest. From our sample of 112 RR Lyr we determine the radial velocity dispersion in the outer halo of the MilkyWay to be 90 km s-1at 50 kpc falling to about 65 km s-1near 100 kpc once a small number of major outliers are removed. With reasonable estimates of the completeness of our sample of 447 candidates and assuming a spherical halo, we find that the stellar density in the outer halo declines as r-4.},

  abstract = {During our Herschel Lensing Survey (HLS) of massive galaxy clusters, we have discovered an exceptionally bright source behind the z = 0.22 cluster Abell 773, which appears to be a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z = 5.2429. This source is unusual compared to most other lensed sources discovered by Herschel so far, because of its higher submm flux (\textasciitilde 200 mJy at 500 {$\mu$}m) and its high redshift. The dominant lens is a foreground z = 0.63 galaxy, not the cluster itself. The source has a far-infrared (FIR) luminosity of L FIR = 1.1 \texttimes{} 10 14/{$\mu$} L {$\odot$}, where {$\mu$} is the magnification factor, likely {$\sim$}11. We report here the redshift identification through CO lines with the IRAM-30 m, and the analysis of the gas excitation, based on CO(7-6), CO(6-5), CO(5-4) detected at IRAM and the CO(2-1) at the EVLA. All lines decompose into a wide and strong red component, and a narrower and weaker blue component, 540 km s -1 apart. Assuming the ultraluminous galaxy (ULIRG) CO-to-H 2 conversion ratio, the H 2 mass is 5.8 \texttimes{} 10 11/{$\mu$} M {$\odot$}, of which one third is in a cool component. From the C I( 3P 2- 3P 1) line we derive a C I/H 2 number abundance of 6 \texttimes{} 10 -5 similar to that in other ULIRGs. The H 2O p(2,0,2-1,1,1) line is strong only in the red velocity component, with an intensity ratio I(H 2O)/I(CO) {$\sim$} 0.5, suggesting a strong local FIR radiation field, possibly from an active nucleus (AGN) component. We detect the [NII]205 {$\mu$}m line for the first time at high-z. It shows comparable blue and red components, with a strikingly broad blue one, suggesting strong ionized gas flows. \textcopyright{} 2012 ESO.},

  abstract = {We report ALMA observations of CO(3-2) emission in the Seyfert 2 double-barred galaxy NGC1433, at the unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.5"=24 pc. Our aim is to probe AGN feeding and feedback phenomena through the morphology and dynamics of the gas inside the central kpc. The CO map, which covers the whole nuclear region (nuclear bar and ring), reveals a nuclear gaseous spiral structure, inside the nuclear ring encircling the nuclear stellar bar. This gaseous spiral is well correlated with the dusty spiral seen in Hubble Space Telescope images. The nuclear spiral winds up in a pseudo-ring at 200 pc radius, which might correspond to the inner ILR. Continuum emission is detected at 0.87 mm only at the very centre, and its origin is more likely thermal dust emission than non-thermal emission from the AGN. It might correspond to the molecular torus expected to exist in this Seyfert 2 galaxy. The HCN(4-3) and HCO+(4-3) lines were observed simultaneously, but only upper limits are derived, with a ratio to the CO(3-2) line lower than 1/60 at 3sigma, indicating a relatively low abundance of very dense gas. The kinematics of the gas over the nuclear disk reveal rather regular rotation only slightly perturbed by streaming motions due to the spiral; the primary and secondary bars are too closely aligned with the galaxy major or minor axis to leave a signature in the projected velocities. Near the nucleus, there is an intense high-velocity CO emission feature redshifted to 200 km/s (if located in the plane), with a blue-shifted counterpart, at 2" (100 pc) from the centre. While the CO spectra are quite narrow in the centre, this wide component is interpreted as an outflow involving a molecular mass of 3.6 10\^6 Mo and a flow rate 7 Mo/yr. The flow could be in part driven by the central star formation, but is mainly boosted by the AGN through its wind or radio jets.},

  abstract = {Modern theories of galaxy formation predict that the Galactic stellar halo was hierarchically assembled from the accretion and disruption of smaller systems. This hierarchical assembly is expected to produce a high degree of structure in the combined phase and chemistry space; this structure should provide a relatively direct probe of the accretion history of our Galaxy. Revealing this structure requires precise 3D positions (including distances), 3D velocities, and chemistry for large samples of stars. The Gaia satellite is delivering proper motions and parallaxes for{$>$}1 billion stars to G {$\approx$} 20. However, radial velocities and metallicities will only be available to G {$\approx$} 15, which is insufficient to probe the outer stellar halo ({$\greaterequivlnt$} 10 kpc). Moreover, parallaxes will not be precise enough to deliver high-quality distances for stars beyond {$\sim$} 10 kpc. Identifying accreted systems throughout the stellar halo therefore requires a large ground-based spectroscopic survey to complement Gaia. Here we provide an overview of the H3 Stellar Spectroscopic Survey, which will deliver precise stellar parameters and spectrophotometric distances for {$\approx$} 200,000 stars to r = 18. Spectra are obtained with the Hectochelle instrument at the MMT, which is configured for the H3 Survey to deliver resolution R {$\approx$} 23,000 spectra covering the wavelength range 5150\AA -5300\AA. The survey is optimized for stellar halo science and therefore focuses on high Galactic latitude fields (|b|{$>$}30\textdegree ), sparsely sampling 15,000 sq. degrees. Targets are selected on the basis of Gaia parallaxes, enabling very efficient selection of bone fide halo stars. The survey began in the Fall of 2017 and has collected 88,000 spectra to-date. All of the data, including the derived stellar parameters, will eventually be made publicly available via the survey website: h3survey.rc.fas.harvard.edu.},

  abstract = {Using galaxy samples drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, we study the relationship between star formation and environment at z {$\sim$} 0.1 and 1. We estimate the total star formation rate (SFR) and specific star formation rate (sSFR) for each galaxy according to the measured [O ii] {$\lambda$} 3727 \AA{} nebular line luminosity, corrected using empirical calibrations to match more robust SFR indicators. Echoing previous results, we find that in the local Universe star formation depends on environment such that galaxies in regions of higher overdensity, on average, have lower SFRs and longer star formation time-scales than their counterparts in lower density regions. At z {$\sim$} 1, we show that the relationship between sSFR and environment mirrors that found locally. However, we discover that the relationship between total SFR and overdensity at z {$\sim$} 1 is inverted relative to the local relation. This observed evolution in the SFR-density relation is driven, in part, by a population of bright, blue galaxies in dense environments at z {$\sim$} 1. This population, which lacks a counterpart at z {$\sim$} 0, is thought to evolve into members of the red sequence from z {$\sim$} 1 to {$\sim$}0. Finally, we conclude that environment does not play a dominant role in the cosmic star formation history at z {$<$} 1: the dependence of the mean galaxy SFR on local galaxy density at constant redshift is small compared to the decline in the global SFR space density over the last 7 Gyr. \textcopyright{} 2007 RAS.},

This is only the second detection of molecular gas emission from an LBG and yields an intrinsic molecular gas mass of (2.4 {$\pm$} 0.4) x 109 M{$\odot$}. The lens reconstruction of the UV morphology of the LBG indicates that it comprises two components separated by {$\sim$}2 kpc. The CO emission is unresolved, \texttheta{} {$\lessequivlnt$}, 3 {${''}$}, and appears to be centered on the intrinsically fainter (and also less highly magnified) of the two UV components. The width of the CO line indicates a dynamical mass of (8 {$\pm$} 2) x 109 csc2/ M{$\odot$} within the central 2 kpc. Employing mid-infrared observations from Spitzer, we infer a stellar mass of M * {$\sim$} (6 {$\pm$} 2) x 109 M{$\odot$} and a star formation rate of {$\sim$}60 M{$\odot$} yr-1 , indicating that the molecular gas will be consumed in {$\lessequivlnt$}40 Myr. The gas fractions, star formation efficiencies, and line widths suggests that LBG J213512 is a high-redshift, gas-rich analog of a local luminous infrared galaxy. This galaxy has a similar gas-to-dynamical mass fraction as observed in the submillimeterselected population, although the gas surface density and star formation efficiency is a factor of 3 times less, suggesting less vigorous activity. We discuss the uncertainties in our conclusions arising from adopting a CO-to-H2 conversion factor appropriate for either the Milky Way or local luminous infrared galaxies. These observations demonstrate that current facilities, when aided by fortuitous gravitational magnification, can study "ordinary" galaxies at high redshift and so act as pathfinders for ALMA. \textcopyright{} 2007.

  abstract = {We present new mm interferometric and optical integral-field unit (IFU) observations and construct a sample of 12 elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies with molecular gas which have both CO and optical maps. The galaxies contain 2 \texttimes{} 107 to 5 \texttimes{} 109 M of molecular gas distributed primarily in central discs or rings (radii 0.5-4 kpc). The molecular gas distributions are always coincident with distributions of optically obscuring dust that reveal tightly wound spiral structures in many cases. The ionized gas always approximately corotates with the molecular gas, evidencing a link between these two gas components, yet star formation is not always the dominant ionization source. The galaxies with less molecular gas tend to have [O iii]/H{$\beta$} emission-line ratios at high values not expected for star formation. Most E/S0s with molecular gas have young or intermediate-age stellar populations based on optical colours, ultraviolet colours and absorption linestrengths. The few that appear purely old lie close to the limit where such populations would be undetectable based on the mass fractions of expected young to observed old stars. The 8 {$\mu$}m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and 24 {$\mu$}m emission yield similar star formation rate (SFR) estimates of E/S0s, but the total infrared overpredicts the rate due to a contribution to dust heating from older stars. The radio-far-infrared relation also has much more scatter than for other star-forming galaxies. However, despite these biases and additional scatter, the derived star formation rates locate the E/S0 galaxies within the large range of the Schmidt-Kennicutt and constant efficiency star formation laws. Thus, the star formation process in E/S0s is not overwhelmingly different than in other star-forming galaxies, although one of the more reliable tracers (24 {$\mu$}m) points to a possible lower star formation efficiency at a given gas surface density. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Authors.

In this paper, the second in the HALO7D series, we present the proper motions for the HALO7D sample. We discuss our measurement methodology, which makes use of a Bayesian mixture modeling approach for creating the stationary reference frame of distant galaxies. Using the 3D kinematic HALO7D sample, we estimate the parameters of the halo velocity ellipsoid, \$\textbackslash langle v\_\{\textbackslash phi\} \textbackslash rangle, \textbackslash sigma\_r, \textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash phi\}, \textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash theta\}\$, and the velocity anisotropy \$\textbackslash beta\$. Using the full HALO7D sample, we find \$\textbackslash beta=0.63 \textbackslash pm 0.05\$ at \$\textbackslash langle r \textbackslash rangle =24\$ kpc. We also estimate the ellipsoid parameters for our sample split into three apparent magnitude bins; the posterior medians for these estimates of \$\textbackslash beta\$, while consistent with one another, increase as a function of mean sample distance. Finally, we estimate \$\textbackslash beta\$ in each of the individual HALO7D fields. We find that the velocity anisotropy \$\textbackslash beta\$ can vary from field to field, which suggests that the halo is not phase mixed at \$\textbackslash langle r \textbackslash rangle =24\$ kpc. We explore the \$\textbackslash beta\$ variation across the skies of two stellar halos from the \textbackslash textit\{Latte\} suite of FIRE-2 simulations, finding that both simulated galaxies show \$\textbackslash beta\$ variation over a similar range to the variation observed across the four HALO7D fields. The accretion histories of the two simulated galaxies result in different \$\textbackslash beta\$ variation patterns; spatially mapping \$\textbackslash beta\$ is thus a way forward in characterizing the accretion history of the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {Modern (sub-)millimeter interferometers enable the measurement of the cool gas and dust emission of high-redshift galaxies (z {$>$} 5). However, at these redshifts the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature is higher, approaching, and even exceeding, the temperature of cold dust and molecular gas observed in the local universe. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the warmer CMB on (sub-)millimeter observations of high-redshift galaxies. The CMB affects the observed (sub-)millimeter dust continuum and the line emission (e.g., carbon monoxide, CO) in two ways: (1) it provides an additional source of (both dust and gas) heating and (2) it is a non-negligible background against which the line and continuum emission are measured. We show that these two competing processes affect the way we interpret the dust and gas properties of high-redshift galaxies using spectral energy distribution models. We quantify these effects and provide correction factors to compute what fraction of the intrinsic dust (and line) emission can be detected against the CMB as a function of frequency, redshift, and temperature. We discuss implications on the derived properties of high-redshift galaxies from (sub-)millimeter data. Specifically, the inferred dust and molecular gas masses can be severely underestimated for cold systems if the impact of the CMB is not properly taken into account. \textcopyright{} 2013.

  abstract = {We present evidence for very high gas fractions and extended molecular gas reservoirs in normal, near-infrared-selected (BzK) galaxies at z 1.5. Our results are based on multi-configuration CO[2-1] observations obtained at the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. All six star-forming galaxies observed were detected at high significance. High spatial resolution observations resolve the CO emission in four of them, implying sizes of the gas reservoirs of order of 6-11 kpc and suggesting the presence of ordered rotation. The galaxies have UV morphologies consistent with clumpy, unstable disks, and UV sizes that are consistent with those measured in CO. The star formation efficiencies are homogeneously low within the sample and similar to those of local spirals - the resulting gas depletion times are 0.5 Gyr, much higher than what is seen in high-z submillimeter galaxies and quasars. The CO luminosities can be predicted to within 0.15 dex from the observed star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses, implying a tight correlation of the gas mass with these quantities. We use new dynamical models of clumpy disk galaxies to derive dynamical masses for our sample. These models are able to reproduce the peculiar spectral line shapes of the CO emission. After accounting for the stellar and dark matter masses, we derive molecular gas reservoirs with masses of (0.4-1.2)\texttimes 1011 M. The implied conversion (CO luminosity-to-gas mass) factor is very high: {$\alpha$}CO = 3.6 0.8, consistent with a Galactic conversion factor but 4 times higher than that of local ultra-luminous IR galaxies that is typically used for high-redshift objects. The gas mass in these galaxies is comparable to or larger than the stellar mass, and the gas accounts for an impressive 50\%-65\% of the baryons within the galaxies' half-light radii. We are thus witnessing truly gas-dominated galaxies at z {$\sim$} 1.5, a finding that explains the high specific SFRs observed for z {$>$} 1 galaxies. The BzK galaxies can be viewed as scaled-up versions of local disk galaxies, with low-efficiency star formation taking place inside extended, low-excitation gas disks. These galaxies are markedly different than local ULIRGs and high-z submillimeter galaxies and quasars, where higher excitation and more compact gas is found. \textcopyright{} 2010 The American Astronomical Society.},

By exploiting previous knowledge of the velocity range, spatial extent, and size of the CO emission, we measure reliable line fluxes with a signal-to-noise ratio {$>$}4-7 for individual transitions. While the average CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) has a subthermal excitation similar to the Milky Way (MW) up to CO[3-2], we show that the average CO[5-4] emission is four times stronger than assuming MW excitation. This demonstrates that there is an additional component of more excited, denser, and possibly warmer molecular gas. The ratio of CO[5-4] to lower-J CO emission is lower than in local (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and high-redshift starbursting submillimeter galaxies, however, and appears to be closely correlated with the average intensity of the radiation field {$<$}U{$>$} and with the star formation surface density, but not with the star formation efficiency. The luminosity of the CO[5-4] transition is found to be linearly correlated with the bolometric infrared luminosity over four orders of magnitudes. For this transition, z = 1.5 BzK galaxies follow the same linear trend as local spirals and (U)LIRGs and high-redshift star-bursting submillimeter galaxies. The CO[5-4] luminosity is thus empirically related to the dense gas and might be a more convenient way to probe it than standard high-density tracers that are much fainter than CO. We see excitation variations among our sample galaxies that can be linked to their evolutionary state and clumpiness in optical rest-frame images. In one galaxy we see spatially resolved excitation variations, where the more highly excited part of the galaxy corresponds to the location of massive SF clumps. This provides support to models that suggest that giant clumps are the main source of the high-excitation CO emission in high-redshift disk-like galaxies.},

We obtain very high signal-to-noise detections of 11 transitions from 3 species and limits on a further 20 transitions from 9 species. We use the 12CO, [CI] and HCN line strengths to investigate the gas mass, kinematic structure and interstellar medium (ISM) chemistry, and find strong evidence for a two-phase medium comprising a hot, dense, luminous component and an underlying extended cool, low-excitation massive component. Employing photo-dissociation region models we show that on average the molecular gas is exposed to a UV radiation field that is \textasciitilde 1000 x more intense than the Milky Way, with star-forming regions having a characteristic density of n\textasciitilde 10\^4 /cm\^3. These conditions are similar to those found in local ULIRGs and in the central regions of typical starburst galaxies, even though the star formation rate is far higher in this system. The 12CO spectral line energy distribution and line profiles give strong evidence that the system comprises multiple kinematic components with different conditions, including temperature, and line ratios suggestive of high cosmic ray flux within clouds. We show that, when integrated over the galaxy, the gas and star-formation surface densities appear to follow the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, although when compared to high-resolution sub-mm imaging, our data suggest that this relation breaks down on scales of {$<$}100pc. By virtue of the lens amplification, these observations uncover a wealth of information on the star formation and ISM at z\textasciitilde 2.3 at a level of detail that has only recently become possible at z{$<$}0.1, and show the potential physical properties that will be studied in unlensed galaxies when ALMA is in full operation.

Through a deep, 64 h of effective on-source integration with the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we discovered a massive, Mmol = 2.0 {$\pm$} 0.2\texttimes{} 1011 M{$\odot$}, extended, {$\sim$}40 kpc, CO(1-0)-emitting disk in the protocluster surrounding the radio galaxy, MRC 1138-262. The galaxy, at zCO = 2.1478, is a clumpy, massive disk galaxy, M{${_\ast}$} {$\sim$} 5 \texttimes{} 1011 M{$\odot$}, which lies 250 kpc in projection from MRC 1138-262 and is a known H{$\alpha$} emitter, named HAE229. This source has a molecular gas fraction of {$\sim$}30\%. The CO emission has a kinematic gradient along its major axis, centered on the highest surface brightness rest-frame optical emission, consistent with HAE229 being a rotating disk. Surprisingly, a significant fraction of the CO emission lies outside of the UV/optical emission. In spite of this, HAE229 follows the same relation between star-formation rate and molecular gas mass as normal field galaxies. HAE229 is the first CO(1-0) detection of an ordinary, star-forming galaxy in a protocluster. We compare a sample of cluster members at z {$>$} 0.4 thatare detected in low-order CO transitions, with a similar sample of sources drawn from the field. We confirm findings that the CO-luminosity and full-width at half maximum are correlated in starbursts and show that this relation is valid for normal high-z galaxies as well as for those in overdensities. We do not find a clear dichotomy in the integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt relation for protocluster and field galaxies. Our results suggest that environment does not have an impact on the "star-formation efficiency" or the molecular gas content of high-redshift galaxies. Not finding any environmental dependence in these characteristics, especially for such an extended CO disk, suggests that environmentally-specific processes such as ram pressure stripping do not operate efficiently in (proto)clusters.},

The galaxy is spatially and spectrally well resolved in the CO (1\textrightarrow 0) emission line. The total intensity and velocity maps reveal a reasonably ordered system; however, there is some evidence for minor merger activity. A CO (10) counter-image is detected at the 3{$\sigma$} level. Five of the 42 kms-1 channels (with {$>$}5{$\sigma$} detections) are mapped back into the source plane and their total magnification posterior probability distribution functions are sampled. This reveals a roughly linear arrangement, tentatively a rotating disc. We derive a molecular gas mass of Mgas = 1.2 {$\pm$} 0.2 \texttimes{} 1010 M, assuming a ULIRG LCOto- Mgas conversion ratio of {$\alpha$} = 0.8 M (K km s-1 pc2)-1 that agrees well with the derived range of {$\alpha$} = 0.3-1.3M (K km s-1 pc2)-1 for separate dynamical mass estimates at assumed inclinations of i = 90\textdegree -30\textdegree. The lens modelling and CO (1\textrightarrow 0) spectrum asymmetry suggest that there may be substantial (factor 2) preferential lensing of certain individual channels; however, the CO (1\textrightarrow 0) spatially integrated channel flux uncertainties limit the significance of this result. Based on the AGN and CO (1\textrightarrow 0) peak emission positions and the lens model, we predict a distortion of the CO spectral line energy distribution where higher order J lines that may be partially excited by AGN heating will be preferentially lensed owing to their smaller solid angles and closer proximity to the AGN and therefore the cusp of the caustic. Comparison with other lensing inversion results shows that the narrow-line region and AGN radio core in IRAS F10214+4724 are preferentially lensed by a factor of {$>$}3 and 11, respectively, relative to the molecular gas emission. This distorts the global continuum emission spectral energy distribution and strongly suggests caution in unsophisticated uses of IRAS F10214+4724 as an archetype high-redshift ULIRG. We explore two large velocity gradient models, incorporating spatial CO (10) and CO (32) information and present tentative evidence for an extended, low-excitation, cold gas component that implies that the total molecular gas mass in IRAS F10214+4724 is a factor of 2 greater than that calculated using spatially unresolved CO observations. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

  abstract = {Methods. We calibrate about 65 billion individual transit spectra onto the same mean BP/RP instrument through a series of calibration steps, including background subtraction, calibration of the CCD geometry and an iterative procedure for the calibration of CCD efficiency as well as variations of the line-spread function and dispersion across the focal plane and in time. The calibrated transit spectra are then combined for each source in terms of an expansion into continuous basis functions. We discuss the configuration of these basis functions. Results. Time-averaged mean spectra covering the optical to near-infrared wavelength range [330, 1050] nm are published for approximately 220 million objects. Most of these are brighter than G = 17.65 but some BP/RP spectra are published for sources down to G = 21.43. Their signalto-noise ratio varies significantly over the wavelength range covered and with magnitude and colour of the observed objects, with sources around G = 15 having S/N above 100 in some wavelength ranges. The top-quality BP/RP spectra are achieved for sources with magnitudes 9 {$<$} G {$<$} 12, having S/N reaching 1000 in the central part of the RP wavelength range. Scientific validation suggests that the internal calibration was generally successful. However, there is some evidence for imperfect calibrations at the bright end G {$<$} 11, where calibrated BP/RP spectra can exhibit systematic flux variations that exceed their estimated flux uncertainties. We also report that due to long-range noise correlations, BP/RP spectra can exhibit wiggles when sampled in pseudo-wavelength. Conclusions. The Gaia DR3 data products are the expansion coefficients and corresponding covariance matrices for BP and RP separately. Users are encouraged to work with the data in this format, with full covariance information showing that correlations between coefficients are typically very low.

In the magnitude range 18.5 {$<$} g {$<$} 20.5, these stellar populations span a heliocentric distance range of: 10 {$\lessequivlnt$} D BS/kpc {$\lessequivlnt$} 75, 40 {$\lessequivlnt$} D BHB/kpc {$\lessequivlnt$} 100. Contributions from contaminants, such as QSOs, and the effect of photometric uncertainties, are also included in our modeling procedure. We find evidence for a very steep outer halo profile, with power-law index {$\alpha$} 6 beyond Galactocentric radii r = 50 kpc, and even steeper slopes favored ({$\alpha$} 6-10) at larger radii. This result holds true when stars belonging to known overdensities, such as the Sagittarius stream, are included or excluded. We show that, by comparison to numerical simulations, stellar halos with shallower slopes at large distances tend to have more recent accretion activity. Thus, it is likely that the Milky Way has undergone a relatively quiet accretion history over the past several gigayears.

  abstract = {We model the fastest moving (vtot {$>$} 300 km s-1) local (D 3 kpc) halo stars using cosmological simulations and six-dimensional Gaia data. Our approach is to use our knowledge of the assembly history and phase-space distribution of halo stars to constrain the form of the high-velocity tail of the stellar halo. Using simple analytical models and cosmological simulations, we find that the shape of the high-velocity tail is strongly dependent on the velocity anisotropy and number density profile of the halo stars - highly eccentric orbits and/or shallow density profiles have more extended high-velocity tails. The halo stars in the solar vicinity are known to have a strongly radial velocity anisotropy, and it has recently been shown the origin of these highly eccentric orbits is the early accretion of a massive (Mstar {$\sim$} 109 M{$\Sun$}) dwarf satellite. We use this knowledge to construct a prior on the shape of the high-velocity tail. Moreover, we use the simulations to define an appropriate outer boundary of 2r200, beyond which stars can escape. After applying our methodology to the Gaia data, we find a local (r0 = 8.3 kpc) escape speed of vesc(r0) = 528+-2425 km s-1. We use our measurement of the escape velocity to estimate the total Milky Way mass, and dark halo concentration: M200,tot = 1.00+-003124 \texttimes{} 1012 M{$\Sun$}, c200 = 10.9+-4343.

  abstract = {We use a distribution function analysis to estimate the mass of the Milky Way (MW) out to 100 kpc using a large sample of halo stars. These stars are compiled from the literature, and the vast majority (\$\{\textbackslash sim \} 98\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$) have 6D phase-space information. We pay particular attention to systematic effects, such as the dynamical influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and the effect of unrelaxed substructure. The LMC biases the (pre-LMC infall) halo mass estimates towards higher values, while realistic stellar haloes from cosmological simulations tend to underestimate the true halo mass. After applying our method to the MW data, we find a mass within 100 kpc of M (\&lt;100 kpc) = 6.07 {$\pm$} 0.29 (stat.) {$\pm$} 1.21 (sys.) \texttimes{} 1011 M{$\odot$}. For this estimate, we have approximately corrected for the reflex motion induced by the LMC using the Erkal et al. model, which assumes a rigid potential for the LMC and MW. Furthermore, stars that likely belong to the Sagittarius stream are removed, and we include a 5 per cent systematic bias, and a 20 per cent systematic uncertainty based on our tests with cosmological simulations. Assuming the mass\textendash concentration relation for Navarro\textendash Frenk\textendash White haloes, our mass estimate favours a total (pre-LMC infall) MW mass of M200c = 1.01 {$\pm$} 0.24 \texttimes{} 1012 M{$\odot$}, or (post-LMC infall) mass of M200c = 1.16 {$\pm$} 0.24 \texttimes{} 1012 M{$\odot$} when a 1.5 \texttimes{} 1011 M{$\odot$} mass of a rigid LMC is included.},

  abstract = {Modern astronomical surveys are observing spectral data for millions of stars. These spectra contain chemical information that can be used to trace the Galaxy's formation and chemical enrichment history. However, extracting the information from spectra, and making precise and accurate chemical abundance measurements are challenging. Here, we present a data-driven method for isolating the chemical factors of variation in stellar spectra from those of other parameters (i.e. \textbackslash teff, \textbackslash logg, \textbackslash feh). This enables us to build a spectral projection for each star with these parameters removed. We do this with no ab initio knowledge of elemental abundances themselves, and hence bypass the uncertainties and systematics associated with modeling that rely on synthetic stellar spectra. To remove known non-chemical factors of variation, we develop and implement a neural network architecture that learns a disentangled spectral representation. We simulate our recovery of chemically identical stars using the disentangled spectra in a synthetic APOGEE-like dataset. We show that this recovery declines as a function of the signal to noise ratio, but that our neural network architecture outperforms simpler modeling choices. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of data-driven abundance-free chemical tagging.},

  abstract = {Geographers and others have written many words about British Columbian environmental politics. Stories about this place often revolve around conflicts between the government, the forest industry, First Nations, and environmentalists, battling it out to secure their vision of appropriate land use on the ground. This paper examines a particularly heated conflict over land use in the Great Bear Rainforest region, a large tract of temperate rainforest blanketing the central and north coasts of British Columbia. But this essay takes a different cut into understanding this particular political event, in that it tracks an often-unrecognized actor through the politics there: the grizzly bear. Drawing inspiration from scholarship that challenges the primacy of humans in our understandings of politics and social life, I argue that the grizzly bear influences and inflects BC's coastal forest politics; it is an important player in the transformation of the Great Bear Rainforest. I tell the story of environmental politics there by tracing the grizzly bear's shifting relationships with others, including with settlers, conservation biologists, environmentalists and money, all of which are consequential for the grizzly bear, and for others in the region. \textcopyright{} 2010 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.},

We find that the halo extends to at least 100 kpc in Galactocentric distance, and obeys a single power-law density profile of index {$\sim$} - 2.5 in two different directions separated by about 150\textdegree{} on the sky. This suggests that the halo is spherical. Our map shows no large kinematically coherent structures (streams, clouds, or plumes) and appears homogeneous. However, we find that at least 20\% of the stars in the halo reside in substructures and that these substructures are dynamically young. The velocity dispersion profile of the halo appears to increase toward large radii while the stellar velocity distribution is non-Gaussian beyond 60 kpc. We argue that the outer halo consists of a multitude of low luminosity overlapping tidal streams from recently accreted objects. \textcopyright{} 2010. The American Astronomical Society.},

  abstract = {DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution, spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We will measure luminous red galaxies up to \$z=1.0\$. To probe the Universe out to even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up to \$z=1.7\$. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts (\$ 2.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.5\$), for the Ly-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million galaxies with a median \$z\textbackslash approx 0.2\$. In total, more than 30 million galaxy and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the third in a series illustrating the power of generalized linear models (GLMs) for the astronomical community, we elucidate the potential of the class of GLMs which handles count data. The size of a galaxy's globular cluster (GC) population (N{$<$}inf{$>$}GC{$<$}/inf{$>$}) is a prolonged puzzle in the astronomical literature. It falls in the category of count data analysis, yet it is usually modelled as if it were a continuous response variable. We have developed a Bayesian negative binomial regression model to study the connection between N{$<$}inf{$>$}GC{$<$}/inf{$>$} and the following galaxy properties: central black hole mass, dynamical bulge mass, bulge velocity dispersion and absolute visual magnitude. The methodology introduced herein naturally accounts for heteroscedasticity, intrinsic scatter, errors in measurements in both axes (either discrete or continuous) and allows modelling the population of GCs on their natural scale as a nonnegative integer variable. Prediction intervals of 99 per cent around the trend for expected NGC comfortably envelope the data, notably including the Milky Way, which has hitherto been considered a problematic outlier. Finally, we demonstrate how random intercept models can incorporate information of each particular galaxy morphological type. Bayesian variable selection methodology allows for automatically identifying galaxy types with different productions of GCs, suggesting that on average S0 galaxies have a GC population 35 per cent smaller than other types with similar brightness.},

  abstract = {Revealing hidden patterns in astronomical data is often the path to fundamental scientific breakthroughs; meanwhile the complexity of scientific enquiry increases as more subtle relationships are sought. Contemporary data analysis problems often elude the capabilities of classical statistical techniques, suggesting the use of cutting edge statistical methods. In this light, astronomers have overlooked a whole family of statistical techniques for exploratory data analysis and robust regression, the so-called Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). In this paper-the first in a series aimed at illustrating the power of these methods in astronomical applications-we elucidate the potential of a particular class of GLMs for handling binary/binomial data, the so-called logit and probit regression techniques, from both a maximum likelihood and a Bayesian perspective. As a case in point, we present the use of these GLMs to explore the conditions of star formation activity and metal enrichment in primordial minihaloes from cosmological hydro-simulations including detailed chemistry, gas physics, and stellar feedback. We predict that for a dark mini-halo with metallicity {$\approx$}1.3\texttimes 10-4Z\{N-ary circled dot operator\}, an increase of 1.2\texttimes 10-2 in the gas molecular fraction, increases the probability of star formation occurrence by a factor of 75\%. Finally, we highlight the use of receiver operating characteristic curves as a diagnostic for binary classifiers, and ultimately we use these to demonstrate the competitive predictive performance of GLMs against the popular technique of artificial neural networks.},

These observations are combined with a compilation of CO measurements from the literature. From this, we infer the CO luminosity correction factors r{$<$}inf{$>$}2,1{$<$}/inf{$>$} = 0.81 {$\pm$} 0.20 and r{$<$}inf{$>$}3,1{$<$}/inf{$>$} = 0.57 {$\pm$} 0.15 for the J = 2 and J = 3 CO transitions, respectively, valid for SFGs at z{$>$} 1. The combined sample of CO-detected SFGs at z{$>$} 1 shows a large spread in star formation efficiency (SFE) with a dispersion of 0.33 dex, such that the SFE extends well beyond the low values of local spirals and overlaps the distribution of z{$>$} 1 submm galaxies. We find that the spread in SFE (or equivalently in molecular gas depletion timescale) is due to the variations of several physical parameters, primarily the specific star formation rate, and also stellar mass and redshift. The dependence of SFE on the offset from the main sequence and the compactness of the starburst is less clear. The possible increase of the molecular gas depletion timescale with stellar mass, now revealed by low M{$<$}inf{$>{_\ast}<$}/inf{$>$} SFGs at z{$>$} 1 and also observed at z = 0, contrasts with the generally acknowledged constant molecular gas depletion timescale and refutes the linearity of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. A net rise of the molecular gas fraction (f{$<$}inf{$>$}gas{$<$}/inf{$>$}) is observed from z \textasciitilde{} 0.2 to z \textasciitilde{} 1.2, followed by a very mild increase toward higher redshifts, as found in earlier studies. At each redshift the molecular gas fraction shows a large dispersion, mainly due to the dependence of f{$<$}inf{$>$}gas{$<$}/inf{$>$} on stellar mass, producing a gradient of increasing f{$<$}inf{$>$}gas{$<$}/inf{$>$} with decreasing M{$<$}inf{$>{_\ast}<$}/inf{$>$}. We provide the first measurement of the molecular gas fraction of z{$>$} 1 SFGs at the low-M{$<$}inf{$>$}\^a-{$<$}/inf{$>$} end between 10\textsuperscript{9.4}9.9, reaching a mean f{$<$}inf{$>$}gas{$<$}/inf{$>$} = 0.69 {$\pm$} 0.18, which shows a clear f{$<$}inf{$>$}gas{$<$}/inf{$>$} upturn at these lower stellar masses. Finally, we find evidence for a nonuniversal dust-to-gas ratio among high-redshift SFGs, high-redshift submm galaxies, local spirals, and local ultraluminous IR galaxies with near-solar metallicities, as inferred from a homogeneous analysis of their rest-frame 850 {$\mu$}m luminosity per unit gas mass. The SFGs with z{$>$} 1 show a trend for a lower L{$<$}inf{$>\mu<$}/inf{$>$}(850 {$\mu$}m)/M{$<$}inf{$>$}gas{$<$}/inf{$>$} mean by 0.33 dex compared to the other galaxy populations.},

  abstract = {We report on the galaxy MACSJ0032-arc at z=3.6314 discovered during the Herschel Lensing snapshot Survey of massive galaxy clusters, and strongly lensed by the cluster MACSJ0032.1+1808. The successful detections of its rest-frame UV, optical, FIR, millimeter, and radio continua, and of its CO emission enable us to characterize, for the first time at such a high redshift, the stellar, dust, and molecular gas properties of a compact star-forming galaxy with a size smaller than 2.5 kpc, a fairly low stellar mass of 4.8x10\^9 Msun, and a moderate IR luminosity of 4.8x10\^11 Lsun. We find that the bulk of the molecular gas mass and star formation seems to be spatially decoupled from the rest-frame UV emission. About 90\% of the total star formation rate is undetected at rest-frame UV wavelengths because of severe obscuration by dust, but is seen through the thermal FIR dust emission and the radio synchrotron radiation. The observed CO(4-3) and CO(6-5) lines demonstrate that high-J transitions, at least up to J=6, remain excited in this galaxy, whose CO spectral line energy distribution resembles that of high-redshift submm galaxies, even though the IR luminosity of MACSJ0032-arc is ten times lower. This high CO excitation is possibly due to the compactness of the galaxy. We find evidence that this high CO excitation has to be considered in the balance when estimating the CO-to-H2 conversion factor. The inferred depletion time of the molecular gas in MACSJ0032-arc supports the decrease in the gas depletion timescale of galaxies with redshift, although to a lesser degree than predicted by galaxy evolution models. Instead, the measured molecular gas fraction as high as 60-79\% in MACSJ0032-arc favors the continued increase in the gas fraction of galaxies with redshift as expected, despite the plateau observed between z\textasciitilde 1.5 and z\textasciitilde 2.5.},

Finally, we find that classifier guidance combines well with upsampling diffusion models, further improving FID to 3.94 on ImageNet 256\$\textbackslash times\$256 and 3.85 on ImageNet 512\$\textbackslash times\$512. We release our code at https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion},

  abstract = {The precise cosmological origin of globular clusters remains uncertain, a situation hampered by the struggle of observational approaches in conclusively identifying the presence, or not, of dark matter in these systems. In this paper, we address this question through an analysis of the particular case of NGC 6809. While previous studies have performed dynamical modelling of this globular cluster using a small number of available kinematic data, they did not perform appropriate statistical inference tests for the choice of best model description; such statistical inference for model selection is important since, in general, different models can result in significantly different inferred quantities. With the latest kinematic data, we use Bayesian inference tests for model selection and thus obtain the best-fitting models, as well as mass and dynamic mass-to-light ratio estimates. For this, we introduce a new likelihood function that provides more constrained distributions for the defining parameters of dynamical models. Initially, we consider models with a known distribution function, and then model the cluster using solutions of the spherically symmetric Jeans equation; this latter approach depends upon the mass density profile and anisotropy {$\beta$} parameter. In order to find the best description for the cluster we compare these models by calculating their Bayesian evidence. We find smaller mass and dynamic mass-to-light ratio values than previous studies, with the best-fitting Michie model for a constant mass-to-light ratio of {$\upsilon$} = 0.90+0.14-0.14 and Mdyn = 6.10+0.51-0.88 \texttimes{} 104M{$\odot$}. We exclude the significant presence of dark matter throughout the cluster, showing that no physically motivated distribution of dark matter can be present away from the cluster core. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

  abstract = {We propose a deep learning framework for modeling complex high-dimensional densities called Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE). It is based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a distribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear deterministic transformation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent space so as to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution, i.e., resulting in independent latent variables. We parametrize this transformation so that computing the determinant of the Jacobian and inverse Jacobian is trivial, yet we maintain the ability to learn complex non-linear transformations, via a composition of simple building blocks, each based on a deep neural network. The training criterion is simply the exact log-likelihood, which is tractable. Unbiased ancestral sampling is also easy. We show that this approach yields good generative models on four image datasets and can be used for inpainting.},

  abstract = {The current COVID-19 pandemic is leading experts to assess the risks posed by the disease and compare policies geared towards stalling its evolution as a global pandemic. In this setting, the virus' basic reproductive number R0, which characterizes the average number of secondary cases generated by each primary case, takes on a significant importance in the quantification of the potential scope of the pandemic. Yet, in most models, R0 is assumed to be a universal constant for the virus across outbreak clusters and populations \textemdash{} thus neglecting the inherent variability of the transmission process due to varying population densities, demographics, temporal factors, etc. In fact, it can be shown that the reproduction number is highly variable. Considering its expected value thus leads to biased or loose results in the reported predictive scenarios, especially as these are tailored to a given country or region. The goal of this paper is the examination of the impact of the reproductive number R's variability on important output metrics, and the percolation of this variability in projected scenarios so as to provide uncertainty quantification. In this perspective, instead of considering a single R0, we consider a distribution of reproductive numbers R and devise a simple Bayesian hierarchical model that builds upon current methods for estimating the R to integrate its heterogeneity. We then simulate the spread of the epidemic, and the impact of different social distancing strategies using a probabilistic framework that models hospital occupancy. This shows the strong impact of this added variability on the reported results. We emphasize that our goal is not to replace benchmark methods for estimating the basic reproductive numbers, nor to devise accurate predictive scenarios, but rather to discuss the importance of the impact of R's heterogeneity on uncertainty quantification for the current COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract = {The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey aims to constrain key Galactic dynamical and chemical evolution parameters by the construction of a large, comprehensive, uniform, infrared-based spectroscopic data set of hundreds of open clusters. This fourth contribution from the OCCAM survey presents analysis using Sloan Digital Sky Survey/APOGEE DR16 of a sample of 128 open clusters, 71 of which we designate to be ``high quality'' based on the appearance of their color\textendash magnitude diagram. We find the APOGEE DR16 derived [Fe/H] abundances to be in good agreement with previous high-resolution spectroscopic open cluster abundance studies. Using the high-quality sample, we measure Galactic abundance gradients in 16 elements, and find evolution of some of the [X/Fe] gradients as a function of age. We find an overall Galactic [Fe/H] versus RGC gradient of -0.068{$\pm$}0.001 dex kpc-1 over the range of 6{$<$}RGC {$<$} 13.9 kpc; however, we note that this result is sensitive to the distance catalog used, varying as much as 15\%. We formally derive the location of a break in the [Fe/H] abundance gradient as a free parameter in the gradient fit for the first time. We also measure significant Galactic gradients in O, Mg, S, Ca, Mn, Cr, Cu, Na, Al, and K, some of which are measured for the first time. Our large sample allows us to examine four well-populated age bins in order to explore the time evolution of gradients for a large number of elements and comment on possible implications for Galactic chemical evolution and radial migration.},

  abstract = {New high resolution interferometer data of 10 IR ultraluminous galaxies shows the molecular gas is in rotating nuclear rings or disks with radii 300 to 800 pc. Most of the CO flux comes from a moderate-density, warm, intercloud medium rather than self-gravitating clouds. Gas masses of \textasciitilde{} 5 x 10\^9 Msun, 5 times lower than the standard method are derived from a model of the molecular disks. The ratio of molecular gas to dynamical mass, is M\_gas/M\_dyn \textasciitilde{} 1/6 with a maximum ratio of gas to total mass surface density of 1/3. For the galaxies VIIZw31, Arp193, and IRAS 10565+24, there is good evidence for rotating molecular rings with a central gap. In addition to the rotating rings a new class of star formation region is identified which we call an Extreme Starburst. They have a characteristic size of only 100 pc., about 10\^9 Msun of gas and an IR luminosity of \textasciitilde 3 x 10\^11 Lsun. Four extreme starbursts are identified in the 3 closest galaxies in the sample Arp220, Arp193 and Mrk273. They are the most prodigious star formation events in the local universe, each representing about 1000 times as many OB stars as 30 Doradus. In Arp220, the CO and 1.3 mm continuum maps show the two ``nuclei'' embedded in a central ring or disk and a fainter structure extending 3 kpc to the east, normal to the nuclear disk. There is no evidence that these sources really are the pre-merger nuclei. They are compact, extreme starburst regions containing 10\^9 Msun of dense molecular gas and new stars, but no old stars. Most of the dust emission and HCN emission arises in the two extreme starbursts. The entire bolometric luminosity of Arp\textasciitilde 220 comes from starbursts, not an AGN. In Mrk231, the disk geometry shows that the molecular disk cannot be heated by the AGN; the far IR luminosity of Mrk\textasciitilde 231 is powered by a starburst, not the AGN. (Abridged)},

Convective cells can transport spores from gaps that may be only 1 cm high and lift spores 10 cm or more into the air.

  abstract = {A powerful method to measure the mass profile of a galaxy is through the velocities of tracer particles distributed through its halo. Transforming this kind of data accurately to a mass profile M(r), however, is not a trivial problem. In particular, limited or incomplete data may substantially affect the analysis. In this paper we develop a Bayesian method to deal with incomplete data effectively; we have a hybrid-Gibbs sampler that treats the unknown velocity components of tracers as parameters in the model. We explore the effectiveness of our model using simulated data, and then apply our method to the Milky Way using velocity and position data from globular clusters and dwarf galaxies. We find that in general, missing velocity components have little effect on the total mass estimate. However, the results are quite sensitive to the outer globular cluster Pal 3. Using a basic Hernquist model with an isotropic velocity dispersion, we obtain credible regions for the cumulative mass profile M(r) of the Milky Way, and provide estimates for the model parameters with 95 percent Bayesian credible intervals. The mass contained within 260 kpc is 1.37x10\^12 solar masses, with a 95 percent credible interval of (1.27,1.51)x10\^12 solar masses. The Hernquist parameters for the total mass and scale radius are 1.55 (+0.18/-0.13)x10\^12 solar masses and 16.9 (+4.8/-4.1) kpc, where the uncertainties span the 95 percent credible intervals.

(1997); Deason et al (2011, 2012a). We explore the relationships between assumptions about model parameters and how these assumptions affect mass profile estimates. We also explore how using subsamples of the GC population beyond certain radii affect mass estimates. After exploring the posterior distributions of different parameter assumption scenarios, we conclude that a conservative estimate of the Galaxy's mass within 125kpc is \$5.22\textbackslash times10\^\{11\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, with a \$50\textbackslash\%\$ probability region of \$(4.79, 5.63) \textbackslash times10\^\{11\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. Extrapolating out to the virial radius, we obtain a virial mass for the Milky Way of \$6.82\textbackslash times10\^\{11\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ with \$50\textbackslash\%\$ credible region of \$(6.06, 7.53) \textbackslash times 10\^\{11\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ (\$r\_\{vir\}=185\^\{+7\}\_\{-7\}\$kpc).

The new hierarchical Bayesian approach further improves the framework presented by Eadie, Harris, \& Widrow (2015) and Eadie \& Harris (2016) and builds upon the preliminary reports by Eadie et al (2015a,c). The method uses a distribution function \$f(\textbackslash mathcal\{E\},L)\$ to model the galaxy and kinematic data from satellite objects such as globular clusters (GCs) to trace the Galaxy's gravitational potential. A major advantage of the method is that it not only includes complete and incomplete data simultaneously in the analysis, but also incorporates measurement uncertainties in a coherent and meaningful way. We first test the hierarchical Bayesian framework, which includes measurement uncertainties, using the same data and power-law model assumed in Eadie \& Harris (2016), and find the results are similar but more strongly constrained. Next, we take advantage of the new statistical framework and incorporate all possible GC data, finding a cumulative mass profile with Bayesian credible regions. This profile implies a mass within \$125\$kpc of \$4.8\textbackslash times10\^\{11\}M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ with a 95\textbackslash\% Bayesian credible region of \$(4.0-5.8)\textbackslash times10\^\{11\}M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. Our results also provide estimates of the true specific energies of all the GCs. By comparing these estimated energies to the measured energies of GCs with complete velocity measurements, we observe that (the few) remote tracers with complete measurements may play a large role in determining a total mass estimate of the Galaxy. Thus, our study stresses the need for more remote tracers with complete velocity measurements.},

  abstract = {In a series of three papers, Eadie et al. developed a hierarchical Bayesian method to estimate the Milky Way Galaxy's mass given a physical model for the potential, a measurement model, and kinematic data of test particles such as globular clusters (GCs) or halo stars in the Galaxy's halo. The Galaxy's virial mass was found to have a 95\textbackslash\% Bayesian credible region (c.r.) of \$(0.67, 1.09) \textbackslash times 10\^\{12\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. In the present study, we test the hierarchical Bayesian method against simulated galaxies created in the McMaster Unbiased Galaxy Simulations 2 (MUGS2), for which the true mass is known. We estimate the masses of MUGS2 galaxies using GC analogs from the simulations as tracers. The analysis, completed as a blind test, recovers the true \$M\_\{200\}\$ of the MUGS2 galaxies within 95\textbackslash\% Bayesian c.r. in 8 out of 18 cases. Of the 10 galaxy masses that were not recovered within the 95\textbackslash\% c.r., a large subset have posterior distributions that occupy extreme ends of the parameter space allowed by the priors. A few incorrect mass estimates are explained by the exceptional evolution history of the galaxies. We also find evidence that the model cannot describe both the galaxies' inner and outer structure simultaneously in some cases. After removing the GC analogs associated with the galactic disks, the true masses were found more reliably (13 out of 18 were predicted within the c.r.). Finally, we discuss how representative the GC analogs are of the real GC population in the Milky Way.},

This sample of eight star-forming galaxies at z\textasciitilde 2 selected among the most massive Herschel galaxies in the GOODS-South field is supplemented with eleven galaxies from the public data of the 1.3 mm survey of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field. ALMA reveals systematically dense concentrations of dusty star-formation close to the center of the stellar component of the galaxies. We identify two different starburst regimes: (i) the classical population of starbursts located above the SFR-M* main sequence, with enhanced gas fractions and short depletion times and (ii) a sub-population of galaxies located within the scatter of the main sequence that experience compact star formation with depletion timescales typical of starbursts of \textasciitilde 150 Myr. In both starburst populations, the far infrared and UV are distributed in distinct regions and dust-corrected star formation rates estimated using UV-optical-NIR data alone underestimate the total star formation rate. Starbursts hidden in the main sequence show instead the lowest gas fractions of our sample and could represent the last stage of star-formation before they become passive. Being Herschel-selected, these main sequence galaxies are located in the high-mass end of the main sequence, hence we do not know whether these "starbursts hidden in the main sequence" also exist below 10\^11 Msun. Active galactic nuclei are found to be ubiquitous in these compact starbursts, suggesting that the triggering mechanism also feeds the central black hole or that the active nucleus triggers star formation.},

  abstract = {Machine learning techniques offer a precious tool box for use within astronomy to solve problems involving so-called big data. They provide a means to make accurate predictions about a particular system without prior knowledge of the underlying physical processes of the data. In this article, and the companion papers of this series, we present the set of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) as a fast alternative method for tackling general astronomical problems, including the ones related to the machine learning paradigm. To demonstrate the applicability of GLMs to inherently positive and continuous physical observables, we explore their use in estimating the photometric redshifts of galaxies from their multi-wavelength photometry. Using the gamma family with a log link function we predict redshifts from the PHoto-z Accuracy Testing simulated catalogue and a subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from Data Release 10. We obtain fits that result in catastrophic outlier rates as low as \textasciitilde 1\% for simulated and \textasciitilde 2\% for real data. Moreover, we can easily obtain such levels of precision within a matter of seconds on a normal desktop computer and with training sets that contain merely tho nds of galaxies. Our software is made publicly available as a user-friendly package developed in Python, R and via an interactive web application. This software allows users to apply a set of GLMs to their own photometric catalogues and generates publication quality plots with minimum effort. By facilitating their ease of use to the astronomical community, this paper series aims to make GLMs widely known and to encourage their implementation in future large-scale projects, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

In particular, we show that if the LMC is ignored, the MW mass within 200 kpc is overestimated by as much as 50 per cent. This bias is due to the bulk motion in the outskirts of the Galaxy's halo and can be, at least in part, accounted for with a simple modification to the equilibrium modelling. Finally, we show that the LMC has a substantial effect on the orbit Leo I which acts to increase its present-day speed relative to the MW. We estimate that accounting for a 1.5 \texttimes{} 1011 MLMC would lower the inferred MW mass to {$\sim$} 1012 M.},

A general solution of the Jeans equations for arbitrary axisymmetric scale-free densities in flattened scale-free potentials is given. A two-parameter subset of the solution for the second moments for the self-consistent density of the power-law models, which have exactly spheroidal equipotentials, is examined in detail. In the spherical limit, the potential of these models reduces to, that of the singular power-law spheres. We build the physical three-integral distribution functions that correspond to the flattened stellar components. Next, we attack the problem of finding distribution functions associated with the Jeans solutions in flattened scale-free potentials. The third or partial integral introduced by de Zeeuw, Evans \& Schwarzschild for Binney's model is generalized to thin and near-thin orbits moving in arbitrary axisymmetric scale-free potentials. The partial integral is a modification of the total angular momentum. For the self-consistent power-law models, we show how this enables the construction of simple three-integral distribution functions. The connection between these approximate distribution functions and the Jeans solutions is discussed in some detail. \textcopyright{} 1997 RAS.},

Here we present dynamical models that reproduce these features of the stream in simple Galactic potentials. We find that debris at the apocentres must be dynamically young, being stripped off in pericentric passages either one or two orbital periods ago. The ratio of the leading and trailing apocentres is sensitive to both dynamical friction and the outer slope of the Galactic rotation curve. These dependencies can be understood with simple regularities connecting the apocentric radii, circular velocities, and orbital period of the progenitor. The effect of dynamical friction can be constrained using substructure within the leading apocentre. Our models are far from final; the errors allowed when sampling parameter space are deliberately generous, not every stream feature is reproduced, and we explore a limited set of potentials. Still, it is interesting that we consistently find the mass within 100 kpc to be \textasciitilde 7 \texttimes{} 10 11 M {$\odot$} , with a nearly flat rotation curve between 50 and 100 kpc. This points to a more extended Galactic halo than assumed in some current models. We show one example model in various observational dimensions. A plot of velocity versus distance separates younger from older debris, and suggests that the young trailing debris will serve as an especially useful probe of the outer Galactic potential.},

In this largely theoretical study we modeled the effects of different gill arrangements on the total surface area for spore production. Relative to spore production over a flat surface, gills achieve a maximum 20-fold increase in surface area. The branching of gills produces the same increase in surface area as the formation of free-standing lamellulae (short gills). The addition of lamellulae between every second gill would offer a slightly greater increase in surface area in comparison to the addition of lamellulae between every pair of opposing gills, but this morphology does not appear in nature. Analysis of photographs of mushrooms demonstrates an excellent match between natural gill arrangements and configurations predicted by our model. \textcopyright{} 2009 The British Mycological Society.},

This model parameterizes the possible star formation and enrichment histories, radial birth profiles, and combines them with a migration model that relates present-day orbital radii to birth radii through a Gaussian probability, broadening with age {$\tau$} as {$\sigma$}RM8{$\surd\tau$}/8Gyr. Guided by observations, we assume that stars are born with an initially tight age-metallicity relation at given radius, which becomes subsequently scrambled by radial orbit migration, thereby providing a direct observational constraint on radial orbit migration strength {$\sigma$}RM8. We fit this model with MCMC to the observed age-metallicity distribution of low-a red clump stars with Galactocentric radii between 5 and 14 kpc from APOGEE DR12, sidestepping the complex spatial selection function and accounting for the considerable age uncertainties. This simple model reproduces well the observed data, and we find a global (in radius and time) radial orbit migration efficiency in the Milky Way of {$\sigma$}RM8= 3.6 {$\pm$} 0.1 kpc when marginalizing over all other model aspects. This shows that radial orbit migration in the Milky Way's main disk is indeed rather strong, in line with theoretical expectations: stars migrate by about a half-mass radius over the age of the disk. The model finds the Sun's birth radius at {$\sim$} 5.2 kpc. If such strong radial orbit migration is typical, this mechanism plays indeed an important role in setting the structural regularity of disk galaxies.},

We propose and fit a global model for the Milky Way disk, specified by an inside-out star formation history, radial orbit mixing, and an empirical, parametric model for its chemical evolution. We account for the spatially complex survey selection function, and find that the model fits all data well. We find distinct inside-out growth of the Milky Way disk; the best fit model implies that the half-mass radius of the Milky Way disk has grown by 43\textbackslash\% over the last 7 Gyr. Yet, such inside-out growth still results in present-day age gradient weaker than 0.1 Gyr/kpc. Our model predicts the half-mass and half-light sizes of the Galactic disk at earlier epochs, which can be compared to the observed redshift -size relations of disk galaxies. We show that radial orbit migration can reconcile the distinct disk-size evolution with redshift, also expected from cosmological simulations, with the modest present-day age gradients seen in the Milky Way and other galaxies.},

This model describes the orbit evolution for stars of age \$\textbackslash tau\$ and metallicity [Fe/H], presuming coeval stars were initially born on (near-)circular orbits, and with a unique [Fe/H] at a given birth angular momentum and age. We fit this model to APOGEE red clump stars, accounting for the complex selection function of the survey. The best fit model implies changes of angular momentum of \$\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash langle \textbackslash Delta L\_z \textbackslash rangle\^2\} \textbackslash approx 619\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{kpc\textasciitilde km/s\textasciitilde\}(\textbackslash tau/\textbackslash mathrm\{6\textasciitilde Gyr\})\^\{0.5\}\$, and changes of radial action as \$\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash langle \textbackslash Delta J\_R \textbackslash rangle\^2\} \textbackslash approx 63\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{kpc\textasciitilde km/s\textasciitilde\} (\textbackslash tau/\textbackslash mathrm\{6\textasciitilde Gyr\})\^\{0.6\}\$ at 8 kpc. This suggests that the secular orbit evolution of the disk is dominated by diffusion in angular momentum, with radial heating being an order of magnitude lower.},

  abstract = {A proper understanding of the Milky Way (MW) dwarf galaxies in a cosmological context requires knowledge of their 3D velocities and orbits. However, proper motion (PM) measurements have generally been of limited accuracy and are available only for more massive dwarfs. We therefore present a new study of the kinematics of the MW dwarf galaxies. We use the Gaia DR2 for those dwarfs that have been spectroscopically observed in the literature. We derive systemic PMs for 39 galaxies and galaxy candidates out to 420 kpc, and generally find good consistency for the subset with measurements available from other studies. We derive the implied Galactocentric velocities, and calculate orbits in canonical MW halo potentials of low (0.8 \texttimes{} 10 12 M {$\odot$} ) and high mass (1.6 \texttimes{} 10 12 M {$\odot$} ). Comparison of the distributions of orbital apocenters and 3D velocities to the halo virial radius and escape velocity, respectively, suggests that the satellite kinematics are best explained in the high-mass halo. Tuc III, Crater II, and additional candidates have orbital pericenters small enough to imply significant tidal influences. Relevant to the missing satellite problem, the fact that fewer galaxies are observed to be near apocenter than near pericenter implies that there must be a population of distant dwarf galaxies yet to be discovered. Of the 39 dwarfs: 12 have orbital poles that do not align with the MW plane of satellites (given reasonable assumptions about its intrinsic thickness); 10 have insufficient PM accuracy to establish whether they align; and 17 satellites align, of which 11 are co-orbiting and (somewhat surprisingly, in view of prior knowledge) 6 are counter-orbiting. Group infall might have contributed to this, but no definitive association is found for the members of the Crater-Leo group.},

These halo tracers are extracted from the (g, r, i, z)-band multi-photometry in the internal data release of the ongoing Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) surveyed over a {$\sim$}550 deg2 area. In order to select the most likely BHBs by removing blue straggler stars (BSs) and other contamination in a statistically significant manner, we have developed and applied an extensive Bayesian method, instead of the simple color cuts adopted in our previous work, where each of the template BHBs and non-BHBs obtained from the available catalogs are represented as a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions in the color-color diagrams. We found from the candidate BHBs in the range of 18.5 {$<$} g {$<$} 23.5 mag that the radial density distribution over a Galactocentric radius of r = 36-360 kpc can be approximated as a single power-law profile with an index of {$\alpha$} =3.74+0.21-0.22 or a broken power-law profile with an index of {$\alpha$}in=2.92+0.33-0.33 at r below a broken radius of b=160+18-19kpc and a very steep slope of {$\alpha$}out=15.0+3.7-4.5 at r {$>$} rb. The latter profile with a prolate shape having an axial ratio of q=1.72+0.44-0.28 is most likely and this halo may hold a rather sharp boundary at r 160 kpc. The slopes of the halo density profiles are compared with those from the suite of hydrodynamical simulations for the formation of stellar halos. This comparison suggests that the MW stellar halo may consist of the two overlapping components: the in situ inner halo as probed by RR Lyrae stars showing a relatively steep radial density profile and the ex situ outer halo with a shallow profile probed by BHBs here, which is made by accretion of small stellar systems.},

  abstract = {We study outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using high-resolution simulations of idealized z {$\sim$} 2 isolated disc galaxies. Episodic accretion events lead to outflows with velocities {$>$}1000 km s-1 and mass outflow rates of about the star formation rate (several tens of M{$\odot$} yr-1). Outflowing winds escape perpendicular to the disc with wide opening angles, and are typically asymmetric (i.e. unipolar) because dense gas above or below the AGN in the resolved disc inhibits outflow. Owing to rapid variability in the accretion rates, outflowing gas may be detectable even when the AGN is effectively 'off'. The highest velocity outflows are sometimes, but not always, concentrated within 2-3 kpc of the galactic centre during the peak accretion. With our purely thermal AGN feedback model-standard in previous literature-the outflowing material is mostly hot ({$>$}106 K) and diffuse (nH {$\leq$} 10-2 cm-3), but includes a cold component entrained in the hot wind. Despite the powerful bursts and high outflow rates, AGN feedback has little effect on the dense gas in the galaxy disc. Thus AGN-driven outflows in our simulations do not cause rapid quenching of star formation, although they may remove significant amounts of gas over long ({$>$}Gyr) time-scales. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

  abstract = {Normalizing flows can generate complex target distributions and thus show promise in many applications in Bayesian statistics as an alternative or complement to MCMC for sampling posteriors. Since no data set from the target posterior distribution is available beforehand, the flow is typically trained using the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence that only requires samples from a base distribution. This strategy may perform poorly when the posterior is complicated and hard to sample with an untrained normalizing flow. Here we explore a distinct training strategy, using the direct KL divergence as loss, in which samples from the posterior are generated by (i) assisting a local MCMC algorithm on the posterior with a normalizing flow to accelerate its mixing rate and (ii) using the data generated this way to train the flow. The method only requires a limited amount of a priori input about the posterior, and can be used to estimate the evidence required for model validation, as we illustrate on examples.},

  abstract = {Significance             Monte Carlo methods, tools for sampling data from probability distributions, are widely used in the physical sciences, applied mathematics, and Bayesian statistics. Nevertheless, there are many situations in which it is computationally prohibitive to use Monte Carlo due to slow ``mixing'' between modes of a distribution unless hand-tuned algorithms are used to accelerate the scheme. Machine learning techniques based on generative models offer a compelling alternative to the challenge of designing efficient schemes for a specific system. Here, we formalize Monte Carlo augmented with normalizing flows and show that, with limited prior data and a physically inspired algorithm, we can substantially accelerate sampling with generative models.           ,              Many problems in the physical sciences, machine learning, and statistical inference necessitate sampling from a high-dimensional, multimodal probability distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, the ubiquitous tool for this task, typically rely on random local updates to propagate configurations of a given system in a way that ensures that generated configurations will be distributed according to a target probability distribution asymptotically. In high-dimensional settings with multiple relevant metastable basins, local approaches require either immense computational effort or intricately designed importance sampling strategies to capture information about, for example, the relative populations of such basins. Here, we analyze an adaptive MCMC, which augments MCMC sampling with nonlocal transition kernels parameterized with generative models known as normalizing flows. We focus on a setting where there are no preexisting data, as is commonly the case for problems in which MCMC is used. Our method uses 1) an MCMC strategy that blends local moves obtained from any standard transition kernel with those from a generative model to accelerate the sampling and 2) the data generated this way to adapt the generative model and improve its efficacy in the MCMC algorithm. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of this algorithm and investigate numerically its efficiency, in particular in terms of its propensity to equilibrate fast between metastable modes whose rough location is known a priori but respective probability weight is not. We show that our algorithm can sample effectively across large free energy barriers, providing dramatic accelerations relative to traditional MCMC algorithms.},

  abstract = {We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (G\_BP-G\_RP) colour are also available. The passbands for G, G\_BP, and G\_RP are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 percent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30--40 percent for the parallaxes and by a factor \textasciitilde 2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, G\_BP, and G\_RP is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1 percent level.},

  abstract = {Methods. Stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances provided by Gaia DR3 spectroscopy are combined with DR3 radial velocities and EDR3 astrometry to analyse the relationships between chemistry and Milky Way structure, stellar kinematics, and orbital parameters. Results. The all-sky Gaia chemical cartography allows a powerful and precise chemo-dynamical view of the Milky Way with unprecedented spatial coverage and statistical robustness. First, it reveals the strong vertical symmetry of the Galaxy and the flared structure of the disc. Second, the observed kinematic disturbances of the disc \textemdash seen as phase space correlations\textemdash{} and kinematic or orbital substructures are associated with chemical patterns that favour stars with enhanced metallicities and lower [{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundance ratios compared to the median values in the radial distributions. This is detected both for young objects that trace the spiral arms and older populations. Several {$\alpha$}, iron-peak elements and at least one heavy element trace the thin and thick disc properties in the solar cylinder. Third, young disc stars show a recent chemical impoverishment in several elements. Fourth, the largest chemo-dynamical sample of open clusters analysed so far shows a steepening of the radial metallicity gradient with age, which is also observed in the young field population. Finally, the Gaia chemical data have the required coverage and precision to unveil galaxy accretion debris and heated disc stars on halo orbits through their [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratio, and to allow the study of the chemo-dynamical properties of globular clusters. Conclusions. Gaia DR3 chemo-dynamical diagnostics open new horizons before the era of ground-based wide-field spectroscopic surveys. They unveil a complex Milky Way that is the outcome of an eventful evolution, shaping it to the present day.},

  abstract = {The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) has built the largest moderately high-resolution (R=22, 500) spectroscopic map of the stars across the Milky Way, and including dust-obscured areas. The APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) is the software developed for the automated analysis of these spectra. ASPCAP determines atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from observed spectra by comparing observed spectra to libraries of theoretical spectra, using chi-2 minimization in a multidimensional parameter space. The package consists of a fortran90 code that does the actual minimization, and a wrapper IDL code for book-keeping and data handling. This paper explains in detail the ASPCAP components and functionality, and presents results from a number of tests designed to check its performance. ASPCAP provides stellar effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities precise to 2\%, 0.1 dex, and 0.05 dex, respectively, for most APOGEE stars, which are predominantly giants. It also provides abundances for up to 15 chemical elements with various levels of precision, typically under 0.1 dex. The final data release (DR12) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III contains an APOGEE database of more than 150,000 stars. ASPCAP development continues in the SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 survey.},

  abstract = {We use the first systematic samples of CO millimeter emission in z{$>$}1 'main-sequence' star forming galaxies (SFGs) to study the metallicity dependence of the conversion factor \{\textbackslash alpha\}CO, from CO line luminosity to molecular gas mass. The molecular gas depletion rate inferred from the ratio of the star formation rate (SFR) to CO luminosity, is \textasciitilde 1 Gyr-1 for near-solar metallicity galaxies with stellar masses above M\_S\textasciitilde 1e11 M\_sun. In this regime the depletion rate does not vary more than a factor of two to three as a function of molecular gas surface density, or redshift between z\textasciitilde 0 and 2. Below M\_S the depletion rate increases rapidly with decreasing metallicity. We argue that this trend is not caused by starburst events, by changes in the physical parameters of the molecular clouds, or by the impact of the fundamental metallicity-SFR-stellar mass relation. A more probable explanation is that the conversion factor is metallicity dependent and that star formation can occur in 'CO-dark' gas. The trend is also expected theoretically from the effect of enhanced photodissociation of CO by ultraviolet radiation at low metallicity. From the available z\textasciitilde 0 and z\textasciitilde 1-3 samples we constrain the slope of the log(\{\textbackslash alpha\}CO) -log (metallicity) relation to range between -1 and -2, fairly insensitive to the assumed slope of the gas-star formation rate relation. Because of the lower metallicities near the peak of the galaxy formation activity at z\textasciitilde 1-2 compared to z\textasciitilde 0, we suggest that molecular gas masses estimated from CO luminosities have to be substantially corrected upward for galaxies below M\_S.},

From a practical viewpoint it is more important to know what happens at finite sample size n. In this chapter, we shall explain how we tackle this crucial question from an innovative approach. To this end, we shall review some notions from probability theory such as the Wasserstein distance and the popular Stein's method, and explain how we use these a priori unrelated concepts in order to measure the impact of priors.

The overall system belongs to a larger-scale protocluster environment and is coincident to one of its overdensity peaks. ALMA reveals also the presence of [CII] emission arising from a circumgalactic gas structure, extending out to \textasciitilde 30 kpc. Our morpho-spectral decomposition analysis shows that about 50\% of the total flux resides between the individual galaxy components, in a metal-enriched gaseous envelope characterized by a disturbed morphology and complex kinematics. Similarly to observations of shock-excited [CII] emitted from tidal tails in local groups, our results can be interpreted as a possible signature of interstellar gas stripped by strong gravitational interactions, with a possible contribution from material ejected by galactic outflows and emission triggered by star formation in small faint satellites. Our findings suggest that mergers could be an efficient mechanism of gas mixing in the circumgalactic medium around high-z galaxies, and thus play a key role in the galaxy baryon cycle at early epochs.},

Searching for typical signatures of outflows in the high-velocity tails of the stacked [C II] profile, we observe (i) deviations from a single-component Gaussian model in the combined residuals and (ii) broad emission in the stacked [C II] spectrum, with velocities of | v |{$\lessequivlnt$}500 km s -1 . The significance of these features increases when stacking the subset of galaxies with star formation rates (SFRs) higher than the median (SFR med = 25 M {$\odot$} yr -1 ), thus confirming their star-formation-driven nature. The estimated mass outflow rates are comparable to the SFRs, yielding mass-loading factors of the order of unity (similarly to local star-forming galaxies), suggesting that star-formation-driven feedback may play a lesser role in quenching galaxies at z {$>$} 4. From the stacking analysis of the datacubes, we find that the combined [C II] core emission (| v |{$<$} 200 km s -1 ) of the higher-SFR galaxies is extended on physical sizes of {$\sim$}30 kpc (diameter scale), well beyond the analogous [C II] core emission of lower-SFR galaxies and the stacked far-infrared continuum. The detection of such extended metal-enriched gas, likely tracing circumgalactic gas enriched by past outflows, corroborates previous similar studies, confirming that baryon cycle and gas exchanges with the circumgalactic medium are at work in normal star-forming galaxies already at early epochs.},

The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis\textendash Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain.The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/ research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

However, their pairwise separations are much smaller that what is found by ALMA follow-up of other single-dish surveys or expected from theoretical simulations. Using ALMA and VLA, we have targeted three of these systems to confirm whether the multiple 870\$\textbackslash mu\$m continuum sources lie at the same redshift, successfully detecting \$\^\{12\}\$CO(\$J = 3\$-2) and \$\^\{12\}\$CO(\$J = 1\$-0) lines and being able to confirm that in the three cases all the multiple DSFGs are likely physically associated within the same structure. Therefore, we report the discovery of two new gas-rich dusty protocluster cores (HELAISS02, \$z = 2.171 \textbackslash pm 0.004\$; HXMM20, \$z = 2.602 \textbackslash pm 0.002\$). The third target is located in the well known COSMOS overdensity at \$z = 2.51\$ (named CL J1001+0220 in the literature), for which we do not find any new secure CO(1-0) detection, although some of its members show only tentative detections and require further confirmation. From the gas, dust, and stellar properties of the two new protocluster cores, we find very large molecular gas fractions yet low stellar masses, pushing the sources above the main sequence, while not enhancing their star formation efficiency. We suggest that the sources might be newly formed galaxies migrating to the main sequence. The properties of the three systems compared to each other and to field galaxies may suggest a different evolutionary stage between systems.},

  abstract = {(Abridged) We present in this paper a detailed analysis of the effect of environment on the star-formation activity of galaxies within the EDR of the SDSS. We have used the Halpha emission line to derive the star-formation rate (SFR) for each galaxy within a volume-limited sample of 8598 galaxies with 0.05 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.095 and M(r){$<$}= -20.45. We find that the SFR of galaxies is strongly correlated with the local (projected) galaxy density and thus we present here the density-SFR relation that is analogous to the density-morphology relation. The effect of density on the SFR of galaxies is seen in three ways. First, the overall distribution of SFRs is shifted to lower values in dense environments compared with the field population. Second, the effect is most noticeable for the strongly star-forming galaxies in the 75th percentile of the SFR distribution. Third, there is a ``break'' (or characteristic density) in the density-SFR relation at a local galaxy density of 1h-2 Mpc-2. To understand this break further, we have studied the SFR of galaxies as a function of clustercentric radius from 17 clusters and groups objectively selected from the SDSS EDR data. The distribution of SFRs of cluster galaxies begins to change, compared with the field population, at a clustercentric radius of 3-4 virial radii, which is consistent with the characteristic break in density that we observe in the density-SFR relation. Our tests suggest that the density-morphology relation alone is unlikely to explain the density-SFR relation we observe. Taken all together, these works demonstrate that the decrease in SFR of galaxies in dense environments is a universal phenomenon over a wide range in density (from 0.08 to 10h-2 Mpc-2) and redshift (out to z = 0.5).},

  abstract = {Probabilistic programming has emerged as a powerful paradigm in statistics, applied science, and machine learning: by decoupling modelling from inference, it promises to allow modellers to directly reason about the processes generating data. However, the performance of inference algorithms can be dramatically affected by the parameterisation used to express a model, requiring users to transform their programs in non-intuitive ways. We argue for automating these transformations, and demonstrate that mechanisms available in recent modeling frameworks can implement non-centring and related reparameterisations. This enables new inference algorithms, and we propose two: a simple approach using interleaved sampling and a novel variational formulation that searches over a continuous space of parameterisations. We show that these approaches enable robust inference across a range of models, and can yield more efficient samplers than the best fixed parameterisation.},

These were carried out with the moving mesh code AREPO, together with a comprehensive model for galaxy formation physics, including active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and magnetic fields, which produces realistic galaxy populations in large cosmological simulations. We demonstrate that our simulations reproduce a wide range of present-day observables, in particular, two-component disc-dominated galaxies with appropriate stellar masses, sizes, rotation curves, star formation rates and metallicities. We investigate the driving mechanisms that set present-day disc sizes/scalelengths, and find that they are related to the angular momentum of halo material. We show that the largest discs are produced by quiescent mergers that inspiral into the galaxy and deposit high-angular momentum material into the pre-existing disc, simultaneously increasing the spin of dark matter and gas in the halo. More violent mergers and strong AGN feedback play roles in limiting disc size by destroying pre-existing discs and by suppressing gas accretion on to the outer disc, respectively. The most important factor that leads to compact discs, however, is simply a low angular momentum for the halo. In these cases, AGN feedback plays an important role in limiting central star formation and the formation of a massive bulge.},

We use a suite of high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations that resolve phase space substructure in local volumes around solar-like positions. We show that phase space structure varies significantly between positions in individual galaxies and across the suite. Substructure populates the high-velocity tail unevenly and leads to discrepancies in the mass estimates.

  abstract = {We develop a data-driven model to map stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity) accurately and precisely to broad-band stellar photometry. This model must, and does, simultaneously constrain the passband-specific dust reddening vector in the Milky Way. The model uses a neural network to learn the (de-reddened) absolute magnitude in one band and colors across many bands, given stellar parameters from spectroscopic surveys and parallax constraints from Gaia. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we train our model on a dataset with spectroscopic parameters from LAMOST, APOGEE and GALAH, Gaia parallaxes, and optical and near-infrared photometry from Gaia, Pan-STARRS\textasciitilde 1, 2MASS and WISE. Testing the model on these datasets leads to an excellent fit and a precise - and by construction accurate - prediction of the color-magnitude diagrams in many bands. This flexible approach rigorously links spectroscopic and photometric surveys, and also results in an improved, stellar-temperature-dependent reddening vector. As such, it provides a simple and accurate method for predicting photometry in stellar evolutionary models. Our model will form a basis to infer stellar properties, distances and dust extinction from photometric data, which should be of great use in 3D mapping of the Milky Way. Our trained model may be obtained at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3902382.},

The molecular gas masses derived from the CO and/or dust continuum luminosities show that the fraction of molecular gas mass and the depletion time scale for the cluster galaxies are larger than expected from the scaling relations of molecular gas on stellar mass and offset from the main sequence of star-forming galaxies in general fields. The galaxies closer to the cluster center in terms of both projected position and accretion phase seem to show a larger deviation from the scaling relations. We speculate that the environment of galaxy cluster helps feed the gas through inflow to the member galaxies and also reduce the efficiency of star formation. The stacked Band 3 spectrum of 12 quiescent galaxies with stellar mass \$\textbackslash sim10\^\{11\}\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ within 0.5\$R\_\{200\}\$ shows no detection of CO emission line, giving the upper limit of molecular gas mass and molecular gas fraction to be \${$<$}10\^\{10\}\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \${$<$}10\$\%, respectively. Therefore, the massive galaxies in the cluster core quench the star formation activity while consuming most of the gas reservoirs.},

We apply a contrastive learning framework on multi-band galaxy photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to learn image representations. We then use them for galaxy morphology classification, and fine-tune them for photometric redshift estimation, using labels from the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset and SDSS spectroscopy.

Furthermore, we devise a protocol to quantitatively compare the degree of disentanglement learnt by different models, and show that our approach also significantly outperforms all baselines quantitatively. Unlike InfoGAN, {$\beta$}-VAE is stable to train, makes few assumptions about the data and relies on tuning a single hyperparameter {$\beta$}, which can be directly optimised through a hyperparameter search using weakly labelled data or through heuristic visual inspection for purely unsupervised data.},

We add seven colors to the Cannon model, based on the g, r, i, J, H, K, W1, and W2 magnitudes from APASS, 2MASS \& WISE, which improves our constraints on Teff and logg by up to 20\% and on Ak by up to 70\%. Cross-validation of the model demonstrates that, for high-SNR objects, our inferred labels agree with the APOGEE values to within 50 K in temperature, 0.04 magnitudes in Ak, and {$<$} 0.1 dex in logg, [M/H], [C/M], [N/M], and [\$\textbackslash alpha\$/M]. We apply the model to 450,000 giants in LAMOST DR2 that have not been observed by APOGEE.

Dynamical mass estimates allow us to constrain the CO-to-H\_2 conversion factor to \textbackslash alpha\_CO = 1.7+/-0.8 M\_sun (K km s\^\{-1\} pc\^2)\^-1 for GN20.2a and \textbackslash alpha\_CO = 1.1+/-\^\{1.5\}\_\{1.1\} M\_sun (K km/s pc\^2)\^-1 for GN20.2b. We measure significant offsets (0.5"-1") between the CO and optical emission, indicating either dust obscuration on scales of tens of kpc or that the emission originates from distinct galaxies. CO spectral line energy distributions imply physical conditions comparable to other SMGs and reveal further evidence that GN20.2a and GN20.2b are in different merging stages. We carry out a targeted search for CO emission from the 14 known B-band Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) in the field, tentatively detecting CO in a previously-undetected LBG and placing 3sigma upper limits on the CO luminosities of those that may lie within our bandpass. A blind search for emission line sources down to a 5sigma limiting CO luminosity of L'\_CO(2-1) = 8 X 10\^9 K km/s pc\^2 and covering \textbackslash Delta z = 0.0273 (\textasciitilde 20 comoving Mpc) produces no other strong contenders associated with the proto-cluster.},

  abstract = {The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) is currently in the process of transforming our view of star-forming galaxies in the distant (\$z\textbackslash gtrsim1\$) universe. Before ALMA, most of what we knew about dust-obscured star formation in distant galaxies was limited to the brightest submillimetre sources -- the so-called submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) -- and even the information on those sources was sparse, with resolved (i.e., sub-galactic) observations of the obscured star formation and gas reservoirs typically restricted to the most extreme and/or strongly lensed sources. Starting with the beginning of early science operations in 2011, the last nine years of ALMA observations have ushered in a new era for studies of high-redshift star formation. With its long baselines, ALMA has allowed observations of distant dust-obscured star formation with angular resolutions comparable to -- or even far surpassing -- the best current optical telescopes. With its bandwidth and frequency coverage, it has provided an unprecedented look at the associated molecular and atomic gas in these distant galaxies through targeted follow-up and serendipitous detections/blind line scans. Finally, with its leap in sensitivity compared to previous (sub-)millimetre arrays, it has enabled the detection of these powerful dust/gas tracers much further down the luminosity function through both statistical studies of color/mass-selected galaxy populations and dedicated deep fields. We review the main advances ALMA has helped bring about in our understanding of the dust and gas properties of high-redshift (\$z\textbackslash gtrsim1\$) star-forming galaxies during these first nine years of its science operations, and we highlight the interesting questions that may be answered by ALMA in the years to come.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size e and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter e on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers. \textcopyright{} 2014 Matthew D.

We propose neural transport (NeuTra) HMC, a technique for learning to correct this sort of unfavorable geometry using inverse autoregressive flows (IAF), a powerful neural variational inference technique. The IAF is trained to minimize the KL divergence from an isotropic Gaussian to the warped posterior, and then HMC sampling is performed in the warped space. We evaluate NeuTra HMC on a variety of synthetic and real problems, and find that it significantly outperforms vanilla HMC both in time to reach the stationary distribution and asymptotic effective-sample-size rates.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has become a go-to family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for Bayesian inference problems, in part because we have good procedures for automatically tuning its parameters. Much less attention has been paid to automatic tuning of generalized HMC (GHMC), in which the auxiliary momentum vector is partially updated frequently instead of being completely resampled infrequently. Since GHMC spreads progress over many iterations, it is not straightforward to tune GHMC based on quantities typically used to tune HMC such as average acceptance rate and squared jumped distance. In this work, we propose an ensemble-chain adaptation (ECA) algorithm for GHMC that automatically selects values for all of GHMC's tunable parameters each iteration based on statistics collected from a population of many chains. This algorithm is designed to make good use of SIMD hardware accelerators such as GPUs, allowing most chains to be updated in parallel each iteration. Unlike typical adaptive-MCMC algorithms, our ECA algorithm does not perturb the chain's stationary distribution, and therefore does not need to be ``frozen'' after warmup. Empirically, we find that the proposed algorithm quickly converges to its stationary distribution, producing accurate estimates of posterior expectations with relatively few gradient evaluations.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

  abstract = {There are many uses for linear fitting; the context here is interpolation and denoising of data, as when you have calibration data and you want to fit a smooth, flexible function to those data. Or you want to fit a flexible function to de-trend a time series or normalize a spectrum. In these contexts, investigators often choose a polynomial basis, or a Fourier basis, or wavelets, or something equally general. They also choose an order, or number of basis functions to fit, and (often) some kind of regularization. We discuss how this basis-function fitting is done, with ordinary least squares and extensions thereof. We emphasize that it is often valuable to choose far more parameters than data points, despite folk rules to the contrary: Suitably regularized models with enormous numbers of parameters generalize well and make good predictions for held-out data; over-fitting is not (mainly) a problem of having too many parameters. It is even possible to take the limit of infinite parameters, at which, if the basis and regularization are chosen correctly, the least-squares fit becomes the mean of a Gaussian process. We recommend cross-validation as a good empirical method for model selection (for example, setting the number of parameters and the form of the regularization), and jackknife resampling as a good empirical method for estimating the uncertainties of the predictions made by the model. We also give advice for building stable computational implementations.},

In this work we develop an adaptive version of the pCN algorithm, where the covariance operator of the proposal distribution is adjusted based on sampling history to improve the simulation efficiency. We show that the proposed algorithm satisfies an important ergodicity condition under some mild assumptions. Finally we provide numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

The images are then processed through the exact same neural network used to estimate SDSS morphologies to classify simulated galaxies in four morphological classes (E, S0/a, Sab, Scd). The CNN model classifies simulated galaxies in one of the four main classes with the same uncertainty as for observed galaxies. The mass- size relations of the simulated galaxies divided by morphological type also reproduce well the slope and the normalization of observed relations which confirms a reasonable diversity of optical morphologies in the TNG suite. However we find a weak correlation between optical morphology and Sersic index in the TNG suite as opposed to SDSS which might require further investigation. The stellar mass functions (SMFs) decomposed into different morphologies still show some discrepancies with observations especially at the high-mass end. We find an overabundance of late-type galaxies ({$\sim$} 50 per cent versus {$\sim$} 20 per cent) at the high-mass end [log(M{${_\ast}$}/M\texttheta ) {$>$} 11] of the SMF as compared to observations according to the CNN classifications and a lack of S0 galaxies ({$\sim$} 20 per cent versus {$\sim$} 40 per cent) at intermediate masses.

  abstract = {Traditional cosmological hydrodynamics simulations fail to spatially resolve the circumgalatic medium (CGM), the reservoir of tenuous gas surrounding a galaxy and extending to its virial radius. We introduce the technique of Enhanced Halo Resolution (EHR), enabling more realistic physical modeling of the simulated CGM by consistently forcing gas refinement to smaller scales throughout the virial halo of a simulated galaxy. We investigate the effects of EHR in the TEMPEST simulations, a suite of ENZO-based cosmological zoom simulations following the evolution of an L* galaxy, resolving spatial scales of 500 comoving pc out to 100 comoving kpc in galactocentric radius. Among its many effects, EHR (1) changes the thermal balance of the CGM, increasing its cool gas content and decreasing its warm/hot gas content; (2) preserves cool gas structures for longer periods; and (3) enables these cool clouds to exist at progressively smaller size scales. Observationally, this results in a boost in ``low ions'' like H I and a drop in ``high ions'' like O VI throughout the CGM. These effects of EHR do not converge in the TEMPEST simulations, but extrapolating these trends suggests that the CGM in reality is a mist consisting of ubiquitous, small, long-lived, cool clouds suspended in a hot medium at the virial temperature of the halo. Additionally, we explore the physical mechanisms to explain why EHR produces the above effects, proposing that it works both by (1) better sampling the distribution of CGM phases enabling runaway cooling in the denser, cooler tail of the phase distribution; and (2) preventing cool gas clouds from artificially mixing with the ambient hot halo and evaporating. Evidence is found for both EHR mechanisms occurring in the TEMPEST simulations.},

Typically, one then has to resort to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, or approximations of the normalization constant. Here, we propose that such models can be estimated by minimizing the expected squared distance between the gradient of the log-density given by the model and the gradient of the log-density of the observed data. While the estimation of the gradient of log-density function is, in principle, a very difficult non-parametric problem, we prove a surprising result that gives a simple formula for this objective function. The density function of the observed data does not appear in this formula, which simplifies to a sample average of a sum of some derivatives of the log-density given by the model. The validity of the method is demonstrated on multivariate Gaussian and independent component analysis models, and by estimating an overcomplete filter set for natural image data.},

This interpretation makes strong predictions on the kinematics and distances of these stream stars. Comparison of the structure in old horizontal branch stars, detected by the SDSS team, with the carbon star structure discovered in our own survey, indicates that this halo stream is of comparable age to the Milky Way. It would appear that the Milky Way and the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy have been a strongly interacting system for most of their existence. Once complete, the SDSS will provide a unique data set with which to constrain the dynamical evolution of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy; it will also strongly constrain the mass distribution of the outer Milky Way.},

  abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batchnormalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

  abstract = {We report the results of a pilot study with the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) of 12CO J= 1-0 emission from four submillimetre-selected galaxies at z= 2.2-2.5, each with an existing detection of 12CO J= 3-2, one of which comprises two distinct spatial components. Using the EVLA's most compact configuration, we detect strong, broad [medians: 990kms-1 full width at zero intensity; 540kms-1 full width at half-maximum (FWHM)]J= 1-0 line emission from all of our targets - coincident in position and velocity with their J= 3-2 emission. The median linewidth ratio, {$\sigma$}1-0/{$\sigma$}3-2= 1.15 {$\pm$} 0.06, suggests that the J= 1-0 is more spatially extended than the J= 3-2 emission, a situation confirmed by our maps which reveal velocity structure in several cases and typical sizes of {$\sim$}16kpc FWHM. The median brightness temperature (Tb) ratio is r3-2/1-0= 0.55 {$\pm$} 0.05, consistent with local galaxies with LIR {$>$} 1011L{$\odot$}, noting that our value may be biased high because of the J= 3-2 based sample selection. Naively, this suggests gas masses roughly two times higher than estimates made using higher J transitions of CO, with the discrepancy due entirely to the difference in assumed Tb ratio. We also estimate molecular gas masses using the 12CO J= 1-0 line and the observed global Tb ratios, assuming standard underlying Tb ratios for the non-star-forming and star-forming gas phases as well as a limiting star formation efficiency for the latter in all systems, i.e. without calling upon XCO ({$\equiv\alpha$}). Using this new method, we find a median molecular gas mass of (2.5 {$\pm$} 0.8) \texttimes{} 1010M{$\odot$}, with a plausible range stretching up to three times higher. Even larger masses cannot be ruled out, but are not favoured by dynamical constraints: the median dynamical mass within R{$\sim$} 7kpc for our sample is (2.3 {$\pm$} 1.4) \texttimes{} 1011M{$\odot$} or {$\sim$}6 times more massive than UV-selected galaxies at this epoch. We examine the Schmidt-Kennicutt (S-K) relation for all the distant galaxy populations for which CO J= 1-0 or J= 2-1 data are available, finding small systematic differences between galaxy populations. These have previously been interpreted as evidence for different modes of star formation, but we argue that these differences are to be expected, given the still considerable uncertainties, certainly when considering the probable excitation biases due to the molecular lines used, and the possibility of sustained S-K offsets during the evolution of individual gas-rich systems. Finally, we discuss the morass of degeneracies surrounding molecular gas mass estimates, the possibilities for breaking them, and the future prospects for imaging and studying cold, quiescent molecular gas at high redshifts. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society \textcopyright{} 2011 RAS.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods provide consistent approximations of integrals as the number of iterations goes to infinity. MCMC estimators are generally biased after any fixed number of iterations. We propose to remove this bias by using couplings of Markov chains together with a telescopic sum argument of Glynn and Rhee (2014). The resulting unbiased estimators can be computed independently in parallel. We discuss practical couplings for popular MCMC algorithms. We establish the theoretical validity of the proposed estimators and study their efficiency relative to the underlying MCMC algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the performance and limitations of the method on toy examples, on an Ising model around its critical temperature, on a high-dimensional variable selection problem, and on an approximation of the cut distribution arising in Bayesian inference for models made of multiple modules.},

Inhibitory interference effects are widely observed, but facilitatory interference apparently has an exception: reflexives have been claimed to show no facilitatory interference effects. Because the claim is based on underpowered studies, we conducted a large-sample experiment that investigated both facilitatory and inhibitory interference. In contrast to previous studies, we find facilitatory interference effects in reflexives.

However, we usually do not have the equation of motion describing the flows, or how they are affected by jumps. To this end, we introduce Neural Jump Stochastic Differential Equations that provide a data-driven approach to learn continuous and discrete dynamic behavior, i.e., hybrid systems that both flow and jump. Our approach extends the framework of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations with a stochastic process term that models discrete events. We then model temporal point processes with a piecewise-continuous latent trajectory, where the discontinuities are caused by stochastic events whose conditional intensity depends on the latent state. We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of our model on a range of synthetic and real-world marked point process datasets, including classical point processes (such as Hawkes processes), awards on Stack Overflow, medical records, and earthquake monitoring.},

  abstract = {The gravitational magnification provided by massive galaxy clusters makes it possible to probe the physical conditions in distant galaxies that are of lower luminosity than those in blank fields and likely more representative of the bulk of the high-redshift galaxy population. We aim to constrain the basic properties of molecular gas in a strongly magnified submm galaxy located behind the massive Bullet Cluster. This galaxy (SMM J0658) is split into three images, with a total magnification factor of almost 100. We used the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to search for \{12\}CO(1--0) and \{12\}CO(3--2) line emission from SMM J0658. We also used the SABOCA bolometer camera on the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope to measure the continuum emission at 350 micron. CO(1--0) and CO(3--2) are detected at 6.8 sigma and 7.5 sigma significance when the spectra toward the two brightest images of the galaxy are combined. From the CO(1-0) luminosity we derive a mass of cold molecular gas of (1.8 \textbackslash pm 0.3) * 10\^9 Msun, using the CO to H\_2 conversion factor commonly used for luminous infrared galaxies. This is 45 \textbackslash pm 25 \% of the stellar mass. From the width of the CO lines we derive a dynamical mass within the CO-emitting region L of (1.3 \textbackslash pm 0.4) * 10\^10 (L/1 kpc) Msun. We refine the redshift determination of SMM J0658 to z=2.7793 \textbackslash pm 0.0003. Continuum emission at 350 micron from SMM J0658 was detected with SABOCA at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.6. We study the spectral energy distribution of SMM J0658 and derive a dust temperature of 33\textbackslash pm 5 K and a dust mass of 1.1*10\^7 Msun. SMM J0658 is one of the least massive submm galaxies discovered so far. As a likely representative of the bulk of the submm galaxy population, it is a prime target for future observations.},

This paper tackles the problem of better utilizing GPUs for this task. While GPUs excel at data-parallel tasks, prior approaches are bottlenecked by algorithms that expose less parallelism, such as k-min selection, or make poor use of the memory hierarchy. We propose a design for k-selection that operates at up to 55\% of theoretical peak performance, enabling a nearest neighbor implementation that is 8.5\texttimes{} faster than prior GPU state of the art. We apply it in different similarity search scenarios, by proposing optimized design for brute-force, approximate and compressed-domain search based on product quantization. In all these setups, we outperform the state of the art by large margins. Our implementation enables the construction of a high accuracy k-NN graph on 95 million images from the Yfcc100M dataset in 35 minutes, and of a graph connecting 1 billion vectors in less than 12 hours on 4 Maxwell Titan X GPUs. We have open-sourced our approach1 for the sake of comparison and reproducibility.},

We use data from \$Gaia\$ and the H3 Stellar Spectroscopic Survey to identify 823 high-quality Sagittarius members based on their angular momenta. The H3 Survey is largely unbiased in metallicity, and so our sample of Sagittarius members is similarly unbiased. Stream stars span a wide range in [Fe/H] from \$-0.2\$ to \$\textbackslash approx -3.0\$, with a mean overall metallicity of \$\textbackslash langle\$[Fe/H]\$\textbackslash rangle=-0.99\$. We identify a strong metallicity-dependence to the kinematics of the stream members. At [Fe/H]\$\textbackslash gt -0.8\$ nearly all members belong to the well-known cold (\$\textbackslash sigma\_v \textbackslash lt 20\$ km/s) leading and trailing arms. At intermediate metallicities (\$-1.9 \textbackslash lt\$[Fe/H]\$\textbackslash lt -0.8\$) a significant population (24\$\textbackslash\%\$) emerges of stars that are kinematically offset from the cold arms. These stars also appear to have hotter kinematics. At the lowest metallicities ([Fe/H]\$\textbackslash lesssim-2\$), the majority of stars (69\$\textbackslash\%\$) belong to this kinematically-offset diffuse population. Comparison to simulations suggests that the diffuse component was stripped from the Sagittarius progenitor at earlier epochs, and therefore resided at larger radius on average, compared to the colder metal-rich component. We speculate that this kinematically diffuse, low metallicity, population is the stellar halo of the Sagittarius progenitor system.},

  abstract = {Halo stars orbit within the potential of the Milky Way, and hence their kinematics can be used to understand the underlying mass distribution. However, the inferred mass distribution depends sensitively on assumptions made on the density and the velocity anisotropy profiles of the tracer population. Also, there is a degeneracy between the parameters of the halo and those of the disk or bulge. Most previous attempts that use halo stars have made arbitrary assumptions about these. In this paper, we decompose the Galaxy into three major components - a bulge, a Miyamoto-Nagai disk, and a Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo - and then model the kinematic data of the halo blue horizontal branch and K-giant stars from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration. Additionally, we use the gas terminal velocity curve and the Sgr A{${_\ast}$} proper motion. With the distance of the Sun from the center of the Galaxy R{$\odot$}= 8.5 kpc, our kinematic analysis reveals that the density of the stellar halo has a break at 17.2+1.1-1.0kpc and an exponential cutoff in the outer parts starting at 97.7+15.6-15.8kpc. Also, we find that the tracer velocity anisotropy is radially biased with {$\beta$}s = 0.4 {$\pm$} 0.2 in the outer halo. We measure halo virial mass Mvirto be 0.80+0.31-0.16\texttimes{} 1012M{$\odot$}, concentration c to be 21.1+14.8-8.3, disk mass to be 0.95+0.24-0.30\texttimes{} 1011M{$\odot$}, disk scale length to be 4.9+0.4-0.4kpc, and bulge mass to be 0.91+0.31-0.38\texttimes 1010M{$\odot$}. The halo mass is found to be small, and this has important consequences. The giant stars reveal that the outermost halo stars have low velocity dispersion, but interestingly this suggests a truncation of the stellar halo density rather than a small overall mass of the Galaxy. Our estimates of local escape velocity {$\nu$}esc= 550.9+32.4-22.1km s-1and dark matter density {$\rho$}DM{$\odot$}= 0.0088+0.0024-0.0018M{$\odot$}pc-3(0.35+0.08-0.07GeV cm-3) are in good agreement with recent estimates. Some of the above estimates, in particular Mvir, are dependent on the adopted value of R{$\odot$}and also on the choice of the outer power-law index of the tracer number density.},

The first two epochs, the subject of past analyses, were obtained with ACS/HRC, and have been reanalyzed here. The new third epoch with WFC3/UVIS increases the time baseline and provides better control of systematics. The three-epoch data yield proper-motion random errors of only 1\%-2\% per field. For the LMC this is sufficient to constrain the internal proper-motion dynamics, as will be discussed in a separate paper. Here we focus on the implied center-of-mass proper motions: {$\mu$}W, LMC = -1.910 {$\pm$} 0.020 mas yr -1, {$\mu$}N, LMC = 0.229 {$\pm$} 0.047 mas yr-1, and {$\mu$}W, SMC = -0.772 {$\pm$} 0.063 mas yr-1, {$\mu$}N, SMC = -1.117 {$\pm$} 0.061 mas yr-1. We combine the results with a revised understanding of the solar motion in the Milky Way to derive Galactocentric velocities: vtot, LMC = 321 {$\pm$} 24 km s-1 and vtot, SMC = 217 {$\pm$} 26 km s-1. Our proper-motion uncertainties are now dominated by limitations in our understanding of the internal kinematics and geometry of the Clouds, and our velocity uncertainties are dominated by distance errors. Orbit calculations for the Clouds around the Milky Way allow a range of orbital periods, depending on the uncertain masses of the Milky Way and LMC. Periods {$\lessequivlnt$} 4 Gyr are ruled out, which poses a challenge for traditional Magellanic Stream models. First-infall orbits are preferred (as supported by other arguments as well) if one imposes the requirement that the LMC and SMC must have been a bound pair for at least several Gyr. \textcopyright{} 2013.

We use the rotation curve method to determine the dark matter distribution and total mass under different assumptions for the dark matter profile, while the total stellar mass is constrained by surface stellar density and microlensing measurements. We also include uncertainties on the baryonic morphology via Bayesian model averaging, thus converting a potential source of systematic error into a more manageable statistical uncertainty. We evaluate the robustness of our result against various possible systematics, including rotation curve data selection, uncertainty on the Sun's velocity V0, dependence on the dark matter profile assumptions, and choice of priors. We find the Milky Way's dark matter virial mass to be log10M200DM/ Mo\&dot; = 11.92+0.06-0.05(stat){$\pm$}0.28{$\pm$}0.27(syst) (M200DM=8.3+1.2-0.9(stat)\texttimes 1011 Mo\&dot;).

Star formation in the disks and nuclear regions of galaxies are reviewed separately, then discussed within a common interpretive framework.

The results are used to study the evolution of these clouds in the interval 2.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.5. We find: 1) The differential density distribution of forest clouds, f (NHI), fits an empirical power law with a typical slope of -1.35 \textrightarrow{} -1.55 for clouds with NHI {$\leq$} 1014.3 cm-2 and changes extremely slowly with redshift over this NHI range. 2) The deviation of f (NHI) from this power-law distribution at higher column densities depends on redshift: for higher redshifts, the departure from a powerlaw distribution occurs at higher NHI, which means that higher column density clouds rapidly disappear with decreasing redshift. This may be consistent with an invariant shape for the different column density distributions, but with a shift to a lower column density normalization for systems at different redshifts driven by the overall expansion of the universe. 3) The line widths of the forest clouds increase as redshift decreases. 4) The correlation strength of the forest clouds seems to increase as redshift decreases. We discuss these results in terms of the evolution of the IGM comparing the results to models and analytic descriptions of the evolution of structure in the gas.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

We propose a new type of normalizing flow, inverse autoregressive flow (IAF), that, in contrast to earlier published flows, scales well to high-dimensional latent spaces. The proposed flow consists of a chain of invertible transformations, where each transformation is based on an autoregressive neural network. In experiments, we show that IAF significantly improves upon diagonal Gaussian approximate posteriors. In addition, we demonstrate that a novel type of variational autoencoder, coupled with IAF, is competitive with neural autoregressive models in terms of attained log-likelihood on natural images, while allowing significantly faster synthesis.},

We find that within the volumes of radius of 570 kpc (400/h kpc for h=0.7) centered on the Milky Way and Andromeda, the average VDF is roughly approximated as n({$>$}Vc)\textasciitilde{} 45(Vc/10 km/s)\^\{-1\} h\^3 Mpc\^\{-3\} for Vc in the range \textasciitilde 10-70 km/s. The observed VDF is compared with results of high-resolution cosmological simulations. We find that the VDF in models is very different from the observed one: n({$>$}Vc)\textasciitilde 1200(Vc/10 km/s)\^\{-2.75\}h\^3 Mpc\^\{-3\}. Cosmological models thus predict that a halo of the size of our Galaxy should have about 50 dark matter satellites with circular velocity {$>$}20 km/s and mass {$>$}3x10\^8/h Msun within a 570 kpc radius. This number is significantly higher than the approximate dozen satellites actually observed around our Galaxy. The observed and predicted VDFs cross at \textasciitilde 50 km/s, indicating that the predicted abundance of satellites with Vc{$>$} 50 km/s is in reasonably good agreement with observations. We conclude, therefore, that unless a large fraction of the Local Group satellites has been missed in observations, there is a dramatic discrepancy between observations and hierarchical models, regardless of the model parameters. We discuss several possible explanations for this discrepancy including identification of some satellites with the High Velocity Clouds observed in the Local Group, and the existence of dark satellites that failed to accrete gas and form stars due either to the expulsion of gas in the supernovae-driven winds or to gas heating by the intergalactic ionizing background.

It is designed to decode the history of the Milky Way, trace the emergence of the chemical elements, reveal the inner workings of stars, and investigate the origin of planets. It will also create an integral-field spectroscopic map of the gas in the Galaxy and the Local Group that is 1,000x larger than the current state of the art and at high enough spatial resolution to reveal the self-regulation mechanisms of galactic ecosystems. SDSS-V will pioneer systematic, spectroscopic monitoring across the whole sky, revealing changes on timescales from 20 minutes to 20 years. The survey will thus track the flickers, flares, and radical transformations of the most luminous persistent objects in the universe: massive black holes growing at the centers of galaxies. The scope and flexibility of SDSS-V will be unique among extant and future spectroscopic surveys: it is all-sky, with matched survey infrastructures in both hemispheres; it provides near-IR and optical multi-object fiber spectroscopy that is rapidly reconfigurable to serve high target densities, targets of opportunity, and time-domain monitoring; and it provides optical, ultra-wide-field integral field spectroscopy. SDSS-V, with its programs anticipated to start in 2020, will be well-timed to multiply the scientific output from major space missions (e.g., TESS, Gaia, eROSITA) and ground-based projects. SDSS-V builds on the 25-year heritage of SDSS's advances in data analysis, collaboration infrastructure, and product deliverables. The project is now refining its science scope, optimizing the survey strategies, and developing new hardware that builds on the SDSS-IV infrastructure. We present here an overview of the current state of these developments as we seek to build our worldwide consortium of institutional and individual members.},

  abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5 M{$\odot$} and near 0.08 M{$\odot$}. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices {$\alpha$} are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by {$\Delta\alpha$} {$\approx$} 0.5 between 0.1 and 1 M{$\odot$} than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto \& Zoccali; Paresce \& De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M\'endez \& Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

This is especially true in high dimensional problems, where most existing algorithms cannot easily move from one mode to another. To address this issue, we propose a novel Bayesian inference approach based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Our method can effectively sample from multimodal distributions, especially when the dimension is high and the modes are isolated. To this end, it exploits and modifies the Riemannian geometric properties of the target distribution to create wormholes connecting modes in order to facilitate moving between them. Further, our proposed method uses the regeneration technique in order to adapt the algorithm by identifying new modes and updating the network of wormholes without affecting the stationary distribution. To find new modes, as opposed to rediscovering those previously identified, we employ a novel mode searching algorithm that explores a residual energy function obtained by subtracting an approximate Gaussian mixture density (based on previously discovered modes) from the target density function.},

The oscillations frequencies are closely related to stellar internal structure properties via the density and the sound speed profiles. Since these properties are in turn tightly linked with the mass and evolutionary state, we can expect to determine the age and mass of a star from the comparison of its oscillation spectrum with the predictions of stellar models. Such a comparison will of course suffer both from the problems we face when modeling a particular star (for instance the uncertainties on its global parameters and chemical composition) and from our general misunderstanding of the physical processes at work in stellar interiors (for instance the various transport processes that may lead to core mixing and affect the ages predicted by models). However for stars where observations have provided very precise and numerous oscillation frequencies together with accurate global parameters and additional information (as the radius or the mass of the star if it is member of a binary system, the radius if it observable in interferometry or the mean density if the star is an exoplanet host), we can also expect to better constrain the physical description of the stellar structure and transport processes and to finally get a more reliable age estimation.},

  abstract = {Accurately characterizing the redshift distributions of galaxies is essential for analysing deep photometric surveys and testing cosmological models. We present a technique to simultaneously infer redshift distributions and individual redshifts from photometric galaxy catalogues. Our model constructs a piecewise constant representation (effectively a histogram) of the distribution of galaxy types and redshifts, the parameters of which are efficiently inferred from noisy photometric flux measurements. This approach can be seen as a generalization of template-fitting photometric redshift methods and relies on a library of spectral templates to relate the photometric fluxes of individual galaxies to their redshifts. We illustrate this technique on simulated galaxy survey data, and demonstrate that it delivers correct posterior distributions on the underlying type and redshift distributions, as well as on the individual types and redshifts of galaxies. We show that even with uninformative priors, large photometric errors and parameter degeneracies, the redshift and type distributions can be recovered robustly thanks to the hierarchical nature of the model, which is not possible with common photometric redshift estimation techniques. As a result, redshift uncertainties can be fully propagated in cosmological analyses for the first time, fulfilling an essential requirement for the current and future generations of surveys.},

  abstract = {Deep learning with artificial neural networks is increasingly gaining attention because of its potential for data-driven astronomy. However, this methodology usually does not provide uncertainties and does not deal with incompleteness and noise in the training data. In this work, we design a neural network for high-resolution spectroscopic analysis using APO Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) data that mimics the methodology of standard spectroscopic analyses: stellar parameters are determined using the full wavelength range, but individual element abundances use censored portions of the spectrum. We train this network with a customized objective function that deals with incomplete and noisy training data and apply dropout variational inference to derive uncertainties on our predictions. We determine parameters and abundances for 18 individual elements at the {$\approx$}0.03 dex level, even at low signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate that the uncertainties returned by our method are a realistic estimate of the precision and they automatically blow up when inputs or outputs outside of the training set are encountered, thus shielding users from unwanted extrapolation. By using standard deep-learning tools for GPU acceleration, our method is extremely fast, allowing analysis of the entire APOGEE data set of {$\approx$}250 000 spectra in 10 min on a single, low-cost GPU. We release the stellar parameters and 18 individual-element abundances with associated uncertainty for the entire APOGEE DR14 data set. Simultaneously, we release astroNN, a well-tested, open-source PYTHON package developed for this work, but that is also designed to be a general package for deep learning in astronomy. astroNN is available at https://github.com/henrysky/astroNN with extensive documentation at http://astroNN.read thedocs.io.},

  abstract = {Background: Understanding patterns of chlamydia prevalence is important for addressing inequalities and planning cost-effective control programs. Population-based surveys are costly; the best data for England come from the Natsal national surveys, which are only available once per decade, and are nationally representative but not powered to compare prevalence in different localities. Prevalence estimates at finer spatial and temporal scales are required. Methods: We present a method for estimating local prevalence by modeling the infection, testing, and treatment processes. Prior probability distributions for parameters describing natural history and treatment-seeking behavior are informed by the literature or calibrated using national prevalence estimates. By combining them with surveillance data on numbers of chlamydia tests and diagnoses, we obtain estimates of local screening rates, incidence, and prevalence. We illustrate the method by application to data from England. Results: Our estimates of national prevalence by age group agree with the Natsal-3 survey. They could be improved by additional information on the number of diagnosed cases that were asymptomatic. There is substantial local-level variation in prevalence, with more infection in deprived areas. Incidence in each sex is strongly correlated with prevalence in the other. Importantly, we find that positivity (the proportion of tests which were positive) does not provide a reliable proxy for prevalence. Conclusion: This approach provides local chlamydia prevalence estimates from surveillance data, which could inform analyses to identify and understand local prevalence patterns and assess local programs. Estimates could be more accurate if surveillance systems recorded additional information, including on symptoms. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B211.},

The method of proof relies on a new variant of Stein's method which manipulates Stein operators. We give several applications of these bounds. Our main application is in Bayesian statistics: we derive explicit data-driven bounds on the Wasserstein distance between the posterior distribution based on a given prior and the no-prior posterior based uniquely on the sampling distribution. This is the first finite sample result confirming the well-known fact that with well-identified parameters and large sample sizes, reasonable choices of prior distributions will have only minor effects on posterior inferences if the data are benign.},

From a large number of isolated spiral-spiral pairs similar to the Milky Way/Andromeda system, we find the interquartile range of the ratio of timing mass to true mass to be a factor of 1.8, while the 5 and 95 per cent points of the distribution of this ratio are separated by a factor of 5.7. Here, we define true mass as the sum of the 'virial' masses, M200, of the two dominant galaxies. For present best values of the distance and approach velocity of Andromeda, this leads to a median likelihood estimate of the true mass of the Local Group of 5.27 \texttimes{} 1012 M{$\odot$} or log M LG/M{$\odot$} = 12.72, with an interquartile range of [12.58, 12.83] and a 5-95 per cent range of [12.26, 13.01]. Thus, a 95 per cent lower confidence limit on the true mass of the Local Group is 1.81 \texttimes{} 10 12 M{$\odot$}. A timing estimate of the Milky Way's mass based on the large recession velocity observed for the distant satellite Leo I works equally well, although with larger systematic uncertainties.

  abstract = {We estimate the Milky Way (MW) halo properties using satellite kinematic data including the latest measurements from Gaia DR2. With a simulation-based 6D phase-space distribution function (DF) of satellite kinematics, we can infer halo properties efficiently and without bias, and handle the selection function and measurement errors rigorously in the Bayesian framework. Applying our DF from the EAGLE simulation to 28 satellites, we obtain an MW halo mass of \$M=1.23\_\{-0.18\}\^\{+0.21\}\textbackslash times 10\^\{12\} M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and a concentration of \$c=9.4\_\{ -2.1\}\^\{ +2.8\}\$ with the prior based on the \$M\$-\$c\$ relation. The inferred mass profile is consistent with previous measurements but with better precision and reliability due to the improved methodology and data. Potential improvement is illustrated by combining satellite data and stellar rotation curves. Using our EAGLE DF and best-fit MW potential, we provide much more precise estimates of kinematics for those satellites with uncertain measurements. Compared to the EAGLE DF, which matches the observed satellite kinematics very well, the DF from the semi-analytical model based on the dark-matter-only simulation Millennium II (SAM-MII) over-represents satellites with small radii and velocities. We attribute this difference to less disruption of satellites with small pericenter distances in the SAM-MII simulation. By varying the disruption rate of such satellites in this simulation, we estimate a \$\textbackslash sim 5\textbackslash\%\$ scatter in the inferred MW halo mass among hydrodynamics-based simulations.},

  abstract = {Single image super-resolution (SISR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from the given low-resolution (LR) ones, which is an ill-posed problem because one LR image corresponds to multiple HR images. Recently, learning-based SISR methods have greatly outperformed traditional ones, while suffering from over-smoothing, mode collapse or large model footprint issues for PSNR-oriented, GAN-driven and flow-based methods respectively. To solve these problems, we propose a novel single image super-resolution diffusion probabilistic model (SRDiff), which is the first diffusion-based model for SISR. SRDiff is optimized with a variant of the variational bound on the data likelihood and can provide diverse and realistic SR predictions by gradually transforming the Gaussian noise into a super-resolution (SR) image conditioned on an LR input through a Markov chain. In addition, we introduce residual prediction to the whole framework to speed up convergence. Our extensive experiments on facial and general benchmarks (CelebA and DIV2K datasets) show that 1) SRDiff can generate diverse SR results in rich details with state-of-the-art performance, given only one LR input; 2) SRDiff is easy to train with a small footprint; and 3) SRDiff can perform flexible image manipulation including latent space interpolation and content fusion.},

  abstract = {Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) contains results for 1.812 billion sources in the magnitude range G = 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 34 months of its operational phase. We describe the input data, the models, and the processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia EDR3, as well as the validation of these results performed within the astrometry task. The processing broadly followed the same procedures as for Gaia DR2, but with significant improvements to the modelling of observations. For the first time in the Gaia data processing, colour-dependent calibrations of the line- and point-spread functions have been used for sources with well-determined colours from DR2. In the astrometric processing these sources obtained five-parameter solutions, whereas other sources were processed using a special calibration that allowed a pseudocolour to be estimated as the sixth astrometric parameter. Compared with DR2, the astrometric calibration models have been extended, and the spin-related distortion model includes a self-consistent determination of basic-angle variations, improving the global parallax zero point. Gaia EDR3 gives full astrometric data (positions at epoch J2016.0, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1.468 billion sources (585 million with five-parameter solutions, 882 million with six parameters), and mean positions at J2016.0 for an additional 344 million. Solutions with five parameters are generally more accurate than six-parameter solutions, and are available for 93\% of the sources brighter than G = 17 mag. The median uncertainty in parallax and annual proper motion is 0.02-0.03 mas at magnitude G = 9 to 14, and around 0.5 mas at G = 20. Extensive characterisation of the statistical properties of the solutions is provided, including the estimated angular power spectrum of parallax bias from the quasars.},

  abstract = {We describe a new approach to studying the intergalactic and circumgalactic medium in the local Universe: direct detection through narrow-band imaging of ultra-low surface brightness visible-wavelength line emission. We use the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation EAGLE to investigate the expected brightness of this emission at low redshift (z 0.2). H{$\alpha$} emission in extended halos (analogous to the extended Ly{$\alpha$} halos/blobs detected around galaxies at high redshifts) has a surface brightness of 700 photons cm-2 sr-1 s-1 out to {$\sim$}100 kpc. Mock observations show that the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, equipped with state-of-the-art narrow-band filters, could directly image these structures in exposure times of {$\sim$}10 hours. H{$\alpha$} fluorescence emission from this gas can be used to place strong constraints on the local ultra-violet background, and on gas flows around galaxies. Detecting H{$\alpha$} emission from the diffuse intergalactic medium (the ``cosmic web'') is beyond current capabilities, but would be possible with a hypothetical 1000-lens Dragonfly array.},

  abstract = {We describe plans for adding a wide-field narrow-band imaging capability to the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. Our plans focus on the development of the `Dragonfly Filter-Tilter', a device which places ultra-narrow bandpass interference filters ({$\increment\lambda$} {$\approx$} 1 nm) in front of each of the lenses that make up the array. The filters are at the entrance pupil of the optical system, rather than in a converging beam, so their performance is not degraded by a converging light cone. This allows Dragonfly to image with a spectral bandpass that is an order of magnitude narrower than that of telescopes using conventional narrow-band filters, resulting in a large increase in the contrast and detectability of extended low surface brightness line emission. By tilting the filters, the central wavelength of the transmission curve can be tuned over a range of 7 nm, corresponding to a physical distance range of about 20 Mpc of extragalactic targets. A further benefit of our approach is that it allows off-band observations to be obtained at the same time as on-band observations, so systematic errors introduced by rapid sky variability can be removed with high precision. Taken together, these characteristics should give our imaging system the ability to detect extremely faint low-surface brightness line emission. Future versions of the Dragonfly Telephoto Array may have the sensitivity needed to directly image the circumgalactic medium of local galaxies. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of the concept, and present laboratory measurements that are used to verify the key ideas behind the instrument.},

  abstract = {The present-day Age-Metallicity Relation (AMR) is a record of the star formation history of the Galaxy, as this traces the chemical enrichment of the gas over time. We use a zoomed-in cosmological simulation that reproduces key signatures of the Milky Way (MW), g2.79e12 from the NIHAO-UHD project, to examine how stellar migration and satellite infall shape the AMR across the disk. We find in the simulation, similar to the MW, the AMR in small spatial regions (R, z) shows turning points that connect changes in the direction of the relations. The turning points in the AMR in the simulation, are a signature of late satellite infall. This satellite infall has a mass radio similar as that of the Sagittarius dwarf to the MW ({$\sim$} 0.001). Stars in the apex of the turning points are young and have nearly not migrated. The late satellite infall creates the turning points via depositing metal-poor gas in the disk, triggering star formation of stars in a narrow metallicity range compared to the overall AMR. The main effect of radial migration on the AMR turning points is to widen the metallicity range of the apex. This can happen when radial migration brings stars born from the infallen gas in other spatial bins, with slightly different metallicities, into the spatial bin of interest. These results indicate that it is possible that the passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy played a role in creating the turning points that we see in the AMR in the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

In the region of the "giant submm arc," we uncover seven multiply imaged galaxies (up from the previously known three), of which six are found to be at a redshift of \$z\textbackslash sim2.9\$, and possibly constitute an interacting system. Using a novel forward-modelling approach, we are able to simultaneously deblend and fit SEDs to the individual galaxies that contribute to the giant submm arc, constraining their dust temperatures, far infrared luminosities and star formation rates. The submm arc first identified by SCUBA can now be seen to be composed of at least five distinct sources, four of these within the galaxy group at \$z\textbackslash sim2.9\$. The total unlensed luminosity for this galaxy group is \$(3.1\textbackslash pm0.3) \textbackslash times 10\^\{12\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{L\}\_\textbackslash odot\$, which gives an unlensed star formation rate of \$(450\textbackslash pm50)\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ yr\$\^\{-1\}\$.

Here, we measure the kinematics of mono-age, mono-[Fe/H] populations in the low and high [{$\alpha$}/Fe] discs between 4 R 13 kpc and |z| 2 kpc using 65 719 stars in common between APOGEE DR14 and Gaia DR2 for which we estimate ages using a Bayesian neural network model trained on asteroseismic ages. We determine the vertical and radial velocity dispersions, finding that the low and high [{$\alpha$}/Fe] discs display markedly different age\textendash velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) and shapes {$\sigma$} z/{$\sigma$} R. The high [{$\alpha$}/Fe] disc has roughly flat AVRs and constant {$\sigma$} z/{$\sigma$} R = 0.64 {$\pm$} 0.04, whereas the low [{$\alpha$}/Fe] disc has large variations in this ratio that positively correlate with the mean orbital radius of the population at fixed age. The high [{$\alpha$}/Fe] disc component's flat AVRs and constant {$\sigma$} z/{$\sigma$} R clearly indicate an entirely different heating history. Outer disc populations also have flatter radial AVRs than those in the inner disc, likely due to the waning effect of spiral arms. Our detailed measurements of AVRs and {$\sigma$} z/{$\sigma$} R across the disc indicate that low [{$\alpha$}/Fe], inner disc (R 10 kpc) stellar populations are likely dynamically heated by both giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while the observed trends for outer disc populations require a significant contribution from another heating mechanism such as satellite perturbations. We also find that outer disc populations have slightly positive mean vertical and radial velocities likely because they are part of the warped disc.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic "dark ages" to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z\textasciitilde 1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than \textasciitilde 1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

With these measurements we trace the dust continuum, far-IR atomic line emission, in particular [CII]\textbackslash,157.7microns, as well as the molecular gas of z\textasciitilde 0.3 (U)LIRGs and perform a detailed investigation of the interstellar medium of the population. We find that the majority of Herschel-selected intermediate redshift (U)LIRGs have L\_CII/L\_FIR ratios that are a factor of about 10 higher than that of local ULIRGs and comparable to that of local normal and high-\$z\$ star forming galaxies. Using our sample to bridge local and high-z [CII] observations, we find that the majority of galaxies at all redshifts and all luminosities follow a L\_CII-L\_FIR relation with a slope of unity, from which local ULIRGs and high-z AGN dominated sources are clear outliers. We also confirm that the strong anti-correlation between the L\_CII/L\_FIR ratio and the far-IR color L\_60/L\_100 observed in the local Universe holds over a broad range of redshifts and luminosities, in the sense that warmer sources exhibit lower L\_CII/L\_FIR at any epoch. Intermediate redshift ULIRGs are also characterised by large molecular gas reservoirs and by lower star formation efficiencies compared to that of local ULIRGs. The high L\_CII/L\_FIR ratios, the moderate star formation efficiencies (L\_LIR/L\_CO or L\_IR/M\_gas) and the relatively low dust temperatures of our sample (which are also common characteristics of high-z star forming galaxies with ULIRG-like luminosities) indicate that the evolution of the physical properties of (U)LIRGs between the present day and z {$>$} 1 is already significant by z \textasciitilde{} 0.3.},

Gas metallicities are measured, for an initial sample of nine star forming galaxies at \textasciitilde{} 3.5, by means of optical nebular lines redshifted into the near-IR. Stellar masses are accurately determined by using Spitzer-IRAC data, which sample the rest-frame near-IR stellar light in these distant galaxies. When compared with previous surveys, the mass-metallicity relation inferred at \textasciitilde{} 3.5 shows an evolution much stronger than observed at lower redshifts. The evolution is prominent even in massive galaxies, indicating that \textasciitilde{} 3 is an epoch of major action in terms of star formation and metal enrichment also for massive systems. There are also indications that the metallicity evolution of low mass galaxies is stronger relative to high mass systems, an effect which can be considered the chemical version of the galaxy downsizing. The mass-metallicity relation observed at \textasciitilde{} 3.5 is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of some hierarchical evolutionary models. Such discrepancies suggest that at {$>$} 3 galaxies are assembled mostly with relatively un-evolved sub-units, i.e. small galaxies with low star formation efficiency. The bulk of the star formation and metallicity evolution probably occurs once small galaxies are already assembled into bigger systems. \textcopyright{} 2008 ESO.},

An index is also given to the complement of technical papers that describe various critical survey components in detail. Finally, we discuss the achieved survey performance and illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data products by way of a number of science demonstrations, which span from time series analysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity variations from stellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics, metallicity and abundance patterns across the Galaxy and as a function of age, to new views of the interstellar medium, the chemistry of star clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar species.

The purpose of M4 was to replicate the results of the previous ones and extend them into three directions: First significantly increase the number of series, second include Machine Learning (ML) forecasting methods, and third evaluate both point forecasts and prediction intervals. The five major findings of the M4 Competitions are: 1. Out Of the 17 most accurate methods, 12 were ``combinations'' of mostly statistical approaches. 2. The biggest surprise was a ``hybrid'' approach that utilized both statistical and ML features. This method's average sMAPE was close to 10\% more accurate than the combination benchmark used to compare the submitted methods. 3. The second most accurate method was a combination of seven statistical methods and one ML one, with the weights for the averaging being calculated by a ML algorithm that was trained to minimize the forecasting. 4. The two most accurate methods also achieved an amazing success in specifying the 95\% prediction intervals correctly. 5. The six pure ML methods performed poorly, with none of them being more accurate than the combination benchmark and only one being more accurate than Na\"ive2. This paper presents some initial results of M4, its major findings and a logical conclusion. Finally, it outlines what the authors consider to be the way forward for the field of forecasting.},

  abstract = {We present a new approach for the approximate K-nearest neighbor search based on navigable small world graphs with controllable hierarchy (Hierarchical NSW, HNSW). The proposed solution is fully graph-based, without any need for additional search structures, which are typically used at the coarse search stage of the most proximity graph techniques. Hierarchical NSW incrementally builds a multi-layer structure consisting from hierarchical set of proximity graphs (layers) for nested subsets of the stored elements. The maximum layer in which an element is present is selected randomly with an exponentially decaying probability distribution. This allows producing graphs similar to the previously studied Navigable Small World (NSW) structures while additionally having the links separated by their characteristic distance scales. Starting search from the upper layer together with utilizing the scale separation boosts the performance compared to NSW and allows a logarithmic complexity scaling. Additional employment of a heuristic for selecting proximity graph neighbors significantly increases performance at high recall and in case of highly clustered data. Performance evaluation has demonstrated that the proposed general metric space search index is able to strongly outperform previous opensource state-of-the-art vector-only approaches. Similarity of the algorithm to the skip list structure allows straightforward balanced distributed implementation.},

  abstract = {This work presents an in-depth analysis of four gravitationally lensed red galaxies at z = 1.6-3.2. The sources are magnified by factors of 2.7-30 by foreground clusters, enabling spectral and morphological measurements that are otherwise challenging. Our sample extends below the characteristic mass of the stellar mass function and is thus more representative of the quiescent galaxy population at z {$>$} 1 than previous spectroscopic studies. We analyze deep VLT/X-SHOOTER spectra and multi-band Hubble Space Telescope photometry that cover the rest-frame UV-to-optical regime. The entire sample resembles stellar disks as inferred from lensing-reconstructed images. Through stellar population synthesis analysis we infer that the targets are young (median age = 0.1-1.2 Gyr) and formed 80\% of their stellar masses within 0.07-0.47 Gyr. Mg II \$\textbackslash lambda\textbackslash lambda 2796,2803\$ absorption is detected across the sample. Blue-shifted absorption and/or redshifted emission of Mg II is found in the two youngest sources, indicative of a galactic-scale outflow of warm (\$T\textbackslash sim10\^\{4\}\$ K) gas. The [O III] \$\textbackslash lambda5007\$ luminosity is higher for the two young sources (median age less than 0.4 Gyr) than the two older ones, perhaps suggesting a decline in nuclear activity as quenching proceeds. Despite high-velocity (\$v\textbackslash approx1500\$ km s\$\^\{-1\}\$) galactic-scale outflows seen in the most recently quenched galaxies, warm gas is still present to some extent long after quenching. Altogether our results indicate that star formation quenching at high redshift must have been a rapid process ({$<$} 1 Gyr) that does not synchronize with bulge formation or complete gas removal. Substantial bulge growth is required if they are to evolve into the metal-rich cores of present-day slow-rotators.},

Automatic differentiation (AD) is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions. The implementation of AD, however, requires some care to insure efficiency. Modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, region-based memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex algorithms. For example, semi-analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and differentiate an algebraic equation. Open and practical problems include the extension of current packages to provide more specialized routines, and finding optimal methods to perform higher-order differentiation.

  abstract = {We introduce the IllustrisTNG project, a new suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO employing an updated Illustris galaxy formation model. Here we focus on the general properties of magnetic fields and the diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters. Magnetic fields are prevalent in galaxies, and their build-up is closely linked to structure formation. We find that structure formation amplifies the initial seed fields (\$10\^\{-14\}\$ comoving Gauss) to the values observed in low-redshift galaxies (\$1-10\textbackslash,\textbackslash mu\{\textbackslash rm G\}\$). The magnetic field topology is closely connected to galaxy morphology such that irregular fields are hosted by early-type galaxies, while large-scale, ordered fields are present in disc galaxies. Using two simple models for the energy distribution of relativistic electrons we predict the diffuse radio emission of \$280\$ clusters with a baryonic mass resolution of \$1.1\textbackslash times 10\^\{7\}\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\}\$, and generate mock observations for VLA, LOFAR, ASKAP and SKA. Our simulated clusters show extended radio emission, whose detectability correlates with their virial mass. We reproduce the observed scaling relations between total radio power and X-ray emission, \$M\_\{500\}\$, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich \$Y\_\{\textbackslash rm 500\}\$ parameter. The radio emission surface brightness profiles of our most massive clusters are in reasonable agreement with VLA measurements of Coma and Perseus. Finally, we discuss the fraction of detected extended radio haloes as a function of virial mass and source count functions for different instruments. Overall our results agree encouragingly well with observations, but a refined analysis requires a more sophisticated treatment of relativistic particles in large-scale galaxy formation simulations.},

In brief: generate a normal variate x and a uniform variate U until In(U) {$<$} 0.5x2 + d - dv + dln(u), then return dv. Here, the gamma parameter is {$\alpha$} {$\geq$} 1, and v = (1 + x/{$\surd$}9d)3, with d = {$\alpha$} - 1/3. The efficiency is high, exceeding 0.951, 0.981, 0.992, 0.996 at {$\alpha$} = 1, 2, 4, 8. The procedure can be made to run faster by means of a simple squeeze that avoids the two logarithms most of the time: return dv if U {$<$} 1 - 0.0331x4. We give a short C program for any {$\alpha$} {$\geq$} 1, and show how to boost an {$\alpha$} {$<$} 1 into an {$\alpha$} {$>$} 1. The gamma procedure is particularly fast for C implementation if the normal variate is generated in-line, via the \#define feature. We include such an inline version, based on our ziggurat method. With it, and an inline uniform generator, gamma variates can be produced in 400MHz CPUs at better than 1.3 million per second, with the parameter a changing from call to call.

Our models for the IGM at intermediate redshifts (2 z 5) are a tremendous success, quantitatively explaining the statistics of Ly{$\alpha$} absorption of intergalactic hydrogen. However, at both lower and higher redshifts (and around galaxies) much is still unknown about the IGM. We review the theoretical models and measurements that form the basis for the modern understanding of the IGM, and we discuss unsolved puzzles (ranging from the largely unconstrained process of reionization at high-z to the missing baryon problem at low-z), highlighting the efforts that have the potential to solve them.},

We consider halos generated from LCDM simulations of gravitational clustering, as well as isolated, spherical collapses. The logarithmic density slopes gamma = d(log rho)/d(log r) of the LCDM halos are found to vary as power-laws in radius, reaching values of gamma \textasciitilde{} -1 at the innermost resolved radii (\textasciitilde 0.01 r\_virial). This behavior is significantly different from that of broken power-law models like the NFW profile, but similar to that of models like de Vaucouleurs'. Accordingly, we compare the N-body density profiles with various parametric models to find which provide the best fit. We consider an NFW-like model with arbitrary inner slope; Dehnen \& McLaughlin's anisotropic model; Einasto's model (identical in functional form to Sersic's model but fit to the space density); and the density model of Prugniel \& Simien that was designed to match the deprojected form of Sersic's R\^\{1/n\} law. Overall, the best-fitting model to the LCDM halos is Einasto's, although the Prugniel-Simien and Dehnen-McLaughlin models also perform well. With regard to the spherical collapse halos, both the Prugniel-Simien and Einasto models describe the density profiles well, with an rms scatter some four times smaller than that obtained with either the NFW-like model or the 3-parameter Dehnen-McLaughlin model. Finally, we confirm recent claims of a systematic variation in profile shape with halo mass.},

  abstract = {Normalizing flows are tractable density models that can approximate complicated target distributions, e.g. Boltzmann distributions of physical systems. However, current methods for training flows either suffer from mode-seeking behavior, use samples from the target generated beforehand by expensive MCMC simulations, or use stochastic losses that have very high variance. To avoid these problems, we augment flows with annealed importance sampling (AIS) and minimize the mass covering {$\alpha$}-divergence with {$\alpha$} = 2, which minimizes importance weight variance. Our method, Flow AIS Bootstrap (FAB), uses AIS to generate samples in regions where the flow is a poor approximation of the target, facilitating the discovery of new modes. We target with AIS the minimum variance distribution for the estimation of the {$\alpha$}-divergence via importance sampling. We also use a prioritized buffer to store and reuse AIS samples. These two features significantly improve FAB's performance. We apply FAB to complex multimodal targets and show that we can approximate them very accurately where previous methods fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to learn the Boltzmann distribution of the alanine dipeptide molecule using only the unnormalized target density and without access to samples generated via Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations: FAB produces better results than training via maximum likelihood on MD samples while using 100 times fewer target evaluations. After reweighting samples with importance weights, we obtain unbiased histograms of dihedral angles that are almost identical to the ground truth ones.},

  abstract = {Ensemble studies of red-giant stars with exquisite asteroseismic (Kepler), spectroscopic (APOGEE), and astrometric (Gaia) constraints offer a novel opportunity to recast and address long-standing questions concerning the evolution of stars and of the Galaxy. Here, we infer masses and ages for nearly 5400 giants with available Kepler light curves and APOGEE spectra using the code param, and discuss some of the systematics that may affect the accuracy of the inferred stellar properties. We then present patterns in mass, evolutionary state, age, chemical abundance, and orbital parameters that we deem robust against the systematic uncertainties explored. First, we look at age-chemical-abundances ([Fe/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe]) relations. We find a dearth of young, metal-rich ([Fe/H] {$>$} 0.2) stars, and the existence of a significant population of old (8-9 Gyr), low-[{$\alpha$}/Fe], super-solar metallicity stars, reminiscent of the age and metallicity of the well-studied open cluster NGC6791. The age-chemo-kinematic properties of these stars indicate that efficient radial migration happens in the thin disc. We find that ages and masses of the nearly 400 {$\alpha$}-element-rich red-giant-branch (RGB) stars in our sample are compatible with those of an old ({$\sim$} 11 Gyr), nearly coeval, chemical-thick disc population. Using a statistical model, we show that the width of the observed age distribution is dominated by the random uncertainties on age, and that the spread of the inferred intrinsic age distribution is such that 95\% of the population was born within {$\sim$} 1.5 Gyr. Moreover, we find a difference in the vertical velocity dispersion between low- and high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] populations. This discontinuity, together with the chemical one in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H] diagram, and with the inferred age distributions, not only confirms the different chemo-dynamical histories of the chemical-thick and thin discs, but it is also suggestive of a halt in the star formation (quenching) after the formation of the chemical-thick disc. We then exploit the almost coeval {$\alpha$}-rich population to gain insight into processes that may have altered the mass of a star along its evolution, which are key to improving the mapping of the current, observed, stellar mass to the initial mass and thus to the age. Comparing the mass distribution of stars on the lower RGB (R {$<$} 11 R ) with those in the red clump (RC), we find evidence for a mean integrated RGB mass loss {$\increment$}M = 0.10 {$\pm$} 0.02 M . Finally, we find that the occurrence of massive (M 1.1 M ) {$\alpha$}-rich stars is of the order of 5\% on the RGB, and significantly higher in the RC, supporting the scenario in which most of these stars had undergone an interaction with a companion.},

  abstract = {Massive galaxy clusters are now found as early as 3 billion years after the Big Bang, containing stars that formed at even earlier epochs. The high-redshift progenitors of these galaxy clusters, termed 'protoclusters', are identified in cosmological simulations with the highest dark matter overdensities. While their observational signatures are less well defined compared to virialized clusters with a substantial hot intra-cluster medium (ICM), protoclusters are expected to contain extremely massive galaxies that can be observed as luminous starbursts. Recent claimed detections of protoclusters hosting such starbursts do not support the kind of rapid cluster core formation expected in simulations because these structures contain only a handful of starbursting galaxies spread throughout a broad structure, with poor evidence for eventual collapse into a protocluster. Here we report that the source SPT2349-56 consists of at least 14 gas-rich galaxies all lying at z = 4.31 based on sensitive observations of carbon monoxide and ionized carbon. We demonstrate that each of these galaxies is forming stars between 50 and 1000 times faster than our own Milky Way, and all are located within a projected region only \$\textbackslash sim\$ 130 kiloparsecs in diameter. This galaxy surface density is more than 10 times the average blank field value (integrated over all redshifts) and \${$>\$$}1000 times the average field volume density. The velocity dispersion (\$\textbackslash sim\$ 410 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$) of these galaxies and enormous gas and star formation densities suggest that this system represents a galaxy cluster core at an advanced stage of formation when the Universe was only 1.4 billion years old. A comparison with other known protoclusters at high redshifts shows that SPT2349-56 is a uniquely massive and dense system that could be building one of the most massive structures in the Universe today.},

Here, we develop our understanding of GANs with the aim of forming a rich view of this growing area of machine learning---to build connections to the diverse set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of algorithms for learning in implicit generative models--models that only specify a stochastic procedure with which to generate data--and relate these ideas to modelling problems in related fields, such as econometrics and approximate Bayesian computation. We develop likelihood-free inference methods and highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs, and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to the general problem of density ratio estimation. There are four approaches for density ratio estimation, one of which is a solution using classifiers to distinguish real from generated data. Other approaches such as divergence minimisation and moment matching have also been explored in the GAN literature, and we synthesise these views to form an understanding in terms of the relationships between them and the wider literature, highlighting avenues for future exploration and cross-pollination.},

  abstract = {1. Bayesian inference is a powerful tool to better understand ecological processes across varied subfields in ecology , and is often implemented in generic and flexible software packages such as the widely used BUGS family (BUGS, WinBUGS, OpenBUGS and JAGS). However, some models have prohibitively long run times when implemented in BUGS. A relatively new software platform called Stan uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms which promise improved efficiency and faster inference relative to those used by BUGS. Stan is gaining traction in many fields as an alternative to BUGS, but adoption has been slow in ecology, likely due in part to the complex nature of HMC. 2. Here, we provide an intuitive illustration of the principles of HMC on a set of simple models. We then compared the relative efficiency of BUGS and Stan using population ecology models that vary in size and complexity. For hierarchical models, we also investigated the effect of an alternative parameterization of random effects, known as non-centering. 3.. For small, simple models there is little practical difference between the two platforms, but Stan outperforms BUGS as model size and complexity grows. Stan also performs well for hierarchical models, but is more sensitive to model parameterization than BUGS. Stan may also be more robust to biased inference caused by pathologies, because it produces diagnostic warnings where BUGS provides none. Disadvantages of Stan include an inability to use discrete parameters, more complex diagnostics and a greater requirement for hands-on tuning. 4. Given these results, Stan is a valuable tool for many ecologists utilizing Bayesian inference, particularly for problems where BUGS is prohibitively slow. As such, Stan can extend the boundaries of feasible models for applied problems, leading to better understanding of ecological processes. Fields that would likely benefit include estimation of individual and population growth rates, meta-analyses and cross-system comparisons and spa-tiotemporal models.},

  abstract = {The kinematics of satellite galaxies reflect the masses of the extended dark matter haloes in which they orbit, and thus shed light on the mass-luminosity relation (MLR) of their corresponding central galaxies. In this paper, we select a large sample of centrals and satellites from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and measure the kinematics (velocity dispersions) of the satellite galaxies as a function of the r-band luminosity of the central galaxies. Using the analytical framework presented in More, van den Bosch \& Cacciato, we use these data to infer both the mean and the scatter of the MLR of central galaxies, carefully taking account of selection effects and biases introduced by the stacking procedure. As expected, brighter centrals on average reside in more massive haloes. In addition, we find that the scatter in halo masses for centrals of a given luminosity, {$\sigma$}log M, also increases with increasing luminosity. As we demonstrate, this is consistent with {$\sigma$}log L, which reflects the scatter in the conditional probability function P(Lc|M), being independent of halo mass. Our analysis of the satellite kinematics yields {$\sigma$}log L = 0.16 {$\pm$} 0.04, in excellent agreement with constraints from clustering and group catalogues, and with predictions from a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. We thus conclude that the amount of stochasticity in galaxy formation, which is characterized by {$\sigma$}log L, is well constrained, independent of halo mass and in a good agreement with current models of galaxy formation. \textcopyright{} 2008 RAS.},

We use the Washington photometric system to identify halo stars efficiently for spectroscopic follow-up. Tracers include halo giants (detectable out to more than 100 kpc), blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars, halo stars near the main-sequence turnoff, and the ``blue metal-poor stars'' of Preston, Beers, \&amp; Shectman. We demonstrate the success of our survey by showing spectra of stars we have identified in all these categories, including giants as distant as 75 kpc. We discuss the problem of identifying the most distant halo giants. In particular, extremely metal-poor halo K dwarfs are present in approximately equal numbers to the distant giants for V\&gt;18, and we show that our method will distinguish reliably between these two groups of metal-poor stars. We plan to survey 100 deg2 at high Galactic latitude and expect to increase the numbers of known halo giants, BHB stars, and turnoff stars by more than an order of magnitude. In addition to the strong test that this large sample will provide for the question, Was the Milky Way halo accreted from satellite galaxies? we will improve the accuracy of mass measurements of the Milky Way beyond 50 kpc via the kinematics of the many distant giants and BHB stars we find. We show that one of our first data sets constrains the halo density law over Galactocentric radii of 5-20 kpc and z-heights of 2-15 kpc. The data support a flattened power-law halo with b/a of 0.6 and exponent -3.0. More complex models with a varying axial ratio may be needed with a larger data set.},

  abstract = {High resolution N-body simulations show that the density profiles of dark matter halos formed in the standard CDM cosmogony can be fit accurately by scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. Regardless of their mass, halos are nearly isothermal over a large range in radius, but significantly shallower than r \textendash 2 near the center and steeper than r \textendash 2 in the outer regions. The characteristic overdensity of a halo correlates strongly with halo mass in a manner consistent with the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Matching the shape of the rotation curves of disk galaxies with this halo structure requires (i) disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity, (ii) halo circular velocities to be systematically lower than the disk rotation speed, and (iii) that the masses of halos surrounding bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity. This offers an attractive explanation for the puzzling lack of correlation between luminosity and dynamics in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite companions of bright spiral galaxies, suggesting that the structure of dark matter halos surrounding bright spirals is similar to that of cold dark matter halos.},

We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of halo mass, of initial density fluctuation spectrum, and of the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fit over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation which reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results to previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, which allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

  abstract = {I present a new Markov chain sampling method appropriate for distributions with isolated modes. Like the recently developed method of 'simulated tempering', the 'tempered transition' method uses a series of distributions that interpolate between the distribution of interest and a distribution for which sampling is easier. The new method has the advantage that it does not require approximate values for the normalizing constants of these distributions, which are needed for simulated tempering, and can be tedious to estimate. Simulated tempering performs a random walk along the series of distributions used. In contrast, the tempered transitions of the new method move systematically from the desired distribution, to the easily-sampled distribution, and back to the desired distribution. This systematic movement avoids the inefficiency of a random walk, an advantage that is unfortunately cancelled by an increase in the number of interpolating distributions required. Because of this, the sampling efficiency of the tempered transition method in simple problems is similar to that of simulated tempering. On more complex distributions, however, simulated tempering and tempered transitions may perform differently. Which is better depends on the ways in which the interpolating distributions are 'deceptive'.},

Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions for such an annealing sequence to define an importance sampler. The Markov chain aspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional problems, where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise be very difficult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the estimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs increases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second half of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a generalization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance sampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is most attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of normalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful, since its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of assessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.},

  abstract = {Measuring the escape velocity of the Milky Way is critical in obtaining the mass of the Milky Way, understanding the dark matter velocity distribution, and building the dark matter density profile. In Necib \$\textbackslash\&\$ Lin (2021), we introduced a strategy to robustly measure the escape velocity. Our approach takes into account the presence of kinematic substructures by modeling the tail of the stellar distribution with multiple components, including the stellar halo and the debris flow called the Gaia Sausage (Enceladus). In doing so, we can test the robustness of the escape velocity measurement for different definitions of the "tail" of the velocity distribution, and the consistency of the data with different underlying models. In this paper, we apply this method to the second data release of Gaia and find that a model with at least two components is preferred. Based on a fit with three bound components to account for the disk, relaxed halo, and the Gaia Sausage, we find the escape velocity of the Milky Way at the solar position to be \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm\{esc\}\}= 484.6\^\{+17.8\}\_\{-7.4\}\$ km/s. Assuming a Navarro-Frenck-White dark matter profile, and taken in conjunction with a recent measurement of the circular velocity at the solar position of \$v\_c = 230 \textbackslash pm 10\$ km/s, we find a Milky Way concentration of \$c\_\{200\} = 13.8\^\{+6.0\}\_\{-4.3\}\$ and a mass of \$M\_\{200\} = 7.0\^\{+1.9\}\_\{-1.2\} \textbackslash times 10\^\{11\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, which is considerably lighter than previous measurements.},

In many cases, there is a subset of reference objects for which the stellar labels are known with high(er) fidelity. We take advantage of this with The Cannon, a new data-driven approach for determining stellar labels from spectroscopic data. The Cannon learns from the "known" labels of reference stars how the continuum-normalized spectra depend on these labels by fitting a flexible model at each wavelength; then, The Cannon uses this model to derive labels for the remaining survey stars. We illustrate The Cannon by training the model on only 542 stars in 19 clusters as reference objects, with and as the labels, and then applying it to the spectra of 55,000 stars from APOGEE DR10. The Cannon is very accurate. Its stellar labels compare well to the stars for which APOGEE pipeline (ASPCAP) labels are provided in DR10, with rms differences that are basically identical to the stated ASPCAP uncertainties. Beyond the reference labels, The Cannon makes no use of stellar models nor any line-list, but needs a set of reference objects that span label-space. The Cannon performs well at lower signal-to-noise, as it delivers comparably good labels even at one-ninth the APOGEE observing time. We discuss the limitations of The Cannon and its future potential, particularly, to bring different spectroscopic surveys onto a consistent scale of stellar labels.},

It has proven to be extremely difficult to infer ages and masses directly from red giant spectra using existing methods. From the KEPLER and APOGEE surveys, samples of several thousand stars exist with high-quality spectra and asteroseismic masses. Here we show that from these data we can build a data-driven spectral model using The Cannon, which can determine stellar masses to \$\textbackslash sim\$ 0.07 dex from APOGEE DR12 spectra of red giants; these imply age estimates accurate to \$\textbackslash sim\$ 0.2 dex (40 percent). We show that The Cannon constrains these ages foremost from spectral regions with CN absorption lines, elements whose surface abundances reflect mass-dependent dredge-up. We deliver an unprecedented catalog of 80,000 giants (including 20,000 red-clump stars) with mass and age estimates, spanning the entire disk (from the Galactic center to R \$\textbackslash sim\$ 20 kpc). We show that the age information in the spectra is not simply a corollary of the birth-material abundances [Fe/H] and [\$\textbackslash alpha\$/Fe], and that even within a mono-abundance population of stars, there are age variations that vary sensibly with Galactic position. Such stellar age constraints across the Milky Way open up new avenues in Galactic archeology.},

There has been a long-standing theoretical expectation and observational evidence that metallicity ([Fe/H]) and age are informative about a star's orbit, e.g., about its angular momentum and the corresponding mean Galactocentric distance or its vertical motion. Indeed, our analysis of the APOGEEdata confirms that [Fe/H]or age alone can predict the stars' orbits far less well than a combination of the two. Remarkably, we find and show explicitly that, for known [Fe/H]and age, the other abundances [X/Fe] of Galactic disk stars can be predicted well (on average to 0.02 dex) across a wide range of Galactocentric radii, and therefore provide little additional information, e.g., for predicting their orbit. While the age\textendash abundance space for metal-poor stars and potentially for stars near the Galactic center is rich or complex, for the bulk of the Galaxy's low-{$\alpha$} disk it is simple: [Fe/H]and age contain most information, unless [X/Fe] can be measured to 0.02 or better. Consequently, we do not have the precision with current (and likely near-future) data to assign stars to their individual (coeval) birth clusters, from which the disk is presumably formed.

Our methods are primal-dual since they are always able to generate a feasible approximation to the optimum of an appropriately formulated dual problem. Besides other advantages, this useful feature provides the methods with a reliable stopping criterion. The proposed schemes differ from the classical approaches (divergent series methods, mirror descent methods) by presence of two control sequences. The first sequence is responsible for aggregating the support functions in the dual space, and the second one establishes a dynamically updated scale between the primal and dual spaces. This additional flexibility allows to guarantee a boundedness of the sequence of primal test points even in the case of unbounded feasible set (however, we always assume the uniform boundedness of subgradients). We present the variants of subgradient schemes for nonsmooth convex minimization, minimax problems, saddle point problems, variational inequalities, and stochastic optimization. In all situations our methods are proved to be optimal from the view point of worst-case black-box lower complexity bounds. \textcopyright{} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {We derive the mass model of the Milky Way (MW), crucial for Dark Matter (DM) direct and indirect detection, using recent data and a cored dark matter (DM) halo profile, which is favoured by studies of external galaxies. The method used consists in fitting a spherically symmetric model of the Galaxy with a Burkert DM halo profile to available data: MW terminal velocities in the region inside the solar circle, circular velocity as recently estimated from maser star forming regions at intermediate radii, and velocity dispersions of stellar halo tracers for the outermost Galactic region. The latter are reproduced by integrating the Jeans equation for every modeled mass distribution, and by allowing for different velocity anisotropies for different tracer populations. For comparison we also consider a Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We find that the cored profile is the preferred one, with a shallow central density of {$\rho$}H {$\sim$} 4 \texttimes{} 107M{$\odot$}/kpc 3 and a large core radius RH {$\sim$} 10 kpc, as observed in external spirals and in agreement with the mass model underlying the Universal Rotation Curve of spirals. We describe also the derived model uncertainties, which are crucially driven by the poorly constrained velocity dispersion anisotropies of halo tracers. The emerging cored DM distribution has implications for the DM annihilation angular profile, which is much less boosted in the Galactic center direction with respect to the case of the standard {$\Lambda$}CDM, NFW profile. Using the derived uncertainties we discuss finally the limitations and prospects to discriminate between cored and cusped DM profile with a possible observed diffuse DM annihilation signal. The present mass model aims to characterize the present-day description of the distribution of matter in our Galaxy, which is needed to frame current crucial issues of Cosmology, Astrophysics and Elementary Particles. \textcopyright{} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.},

  abstract = {We use the new Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFiT) to model 38 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). We fit their multicolour light curves with a magnetar spin-down model and present the posterior distributions of magnetar and ejecta parameters. The colour evolution of all SLSNe can be well matched with a simple absorbed blackbody. We find the following medians (1{$\sigma$} ranges) for the key parameters: Spin period 2.4 ms (1.2-4 ms); magnetic field 0:8\texttimes 1014 G (0.2-1.8\texttimes 1014 G); ejecta mass 4.8M{$\odot$} (2.2-12.9M{$\odot$}); kinetic energy 3:9\texttimes 1051 erg (1.9-9.8\texttimes 1051 erg). This significantly narrows the parameter space compared to our uninformed priors, showing that although the magnetar model is flexible, the parameter space relevant to SLSNe is actually well constrained by existing data. The requirement that the instantaneous engine power is {$\sim$}1044 erg at the light curve peak necessitates either a large rotational energy (P {$<$} 2 ms), or more commonly that the spin-down and diffusion timescales be well-matched. We find no evidence for separate populations of fastand slow-declining SLSNe, which instead form a continuum both in light curve widths and inferred parameters. Variations in the spectra are well explained through differences in spin-down power and photospheric radii at maximum-light. We find no correlations between any model parameters and the properties of SLSN host galaxies. Comparing our posteriors to stellar evolution models, we show that SLSNe require rapidly rotating (fastest 10\%) massive stars (\& 20M\_), and that this is consistent with the observed SLSN rate. High mass, low metallicity, and likely binary interaction all serve to maintain rapid rotation essential for magnetar formation. By reproducing the full set of SLSN light curves, our posteriors can be used to inform photometric searches for SLSNe in future survey data.},

The observations span three galaxy clusters, derived from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-sequence Cluster Survey. We augment the {$>$}5sigma detections of the CO (2-1) fluxes with multi-band photometry, yielding stellar masses and infrared-derived star formation rates, to place some of the first constraints on molecular gas properties in z\textasciitilde 1.6 cluster environments. We measure sizable gas reservoirs of 0.5-2x10\^11 solar masses in these objects, with high gas fractions and long depletion timescales, averaging 62\% and 1.4 Gyr, respectively. We compare our cluster galaxies to the scaling relations of the coeval field, in the context of how gas fractions and depletion timescales vary with respect to the star-forming main sequence. We find that our cluster galaxies lie systematically off the field scaling relations at z=1.6 toward enhanced gas fractions, at a level of \textasciitilde 4sigma, but have consistent depletion timescales. Exploiting CO detections in lower-redshift clusters from the literature, we investigate the evolution of the gas fraction in cluster galaxies, finding it to mimic the strong rise with redshift in the field. We emphasize the utility of detecting abundant gas-rich galaxies in high-redshift clusters, deeming them as crucial laboratories for future statistical studies.},

  abstract = {We present the first spatially-resolved observations of molecular gas in a sample of cluster galaxies beyond z{$>$}0.1. Using ALMA, we detect CO (2-1) in 8 z\textasciitilde 1.6 cluster galaxies, all within a single 70" primary beam, in under 3 hours of integration time. The cluster, SpARCS-J0225, is replete with gas-rich galaxies in close proximity. It thus affords an efficient multiplexing strategy to build up the first sample of resolved CO in distant galaxy clusters. Mapping out the kinematic structure and morphology of the molecular gas on 3.5 kpc scales reveals rotating gas disks in the majority of the galaxies, as evidenced by smooth velocity gradients. Detailed velocity maps also uncover kinematic peculiarities, including a central gas void, a merger, and a few one-sided gas tails. We compare the extent of the molecular gas component to that of the optical stellar component, measured with rest-frame optical HST imaging. We find that the cluster galaxies, while broadly consistent with a ratio of unity for stellar-to-gas effective radii, have a moderately larger ratio compared to the coeval field; this is consistent with the more pronounced trend in the low-redshift Universe. Thus, at first glance, the z\textasciitilde 1.6 cluster galaxies generally look like galaxies infalling from the field, with typical main-sequence star formation rates and massive molecular gas reservoirs situated in rotating disks. However, there are potentially important differences from their field counterparts, including elevated gas fractions, slightly smaller CO disks, and possible asymmetric gas tails. Taken in tandem, these signatures are tentative evidence for gas-stripping in the z\textasciitilde 1.6 cluster. However, the current sample size of spatially-resolved molecular gas in galaxies at high redshift is small, and verification of these trends will require much larger samples of both cluster and field galaxies.},

  abstract = {Spectroscopy provides an immense amount of information on stellar objects, and this field continues to grow with recent developments in multi-object data acquisition and rapid data analysis techniques. Current automated methods for analyzing spectra are either (a) data-driven models, which require large amounts of data with prior knowledge of stellar parameters and elemental abundances, or (b) based on theoretical synthetic models that are susceptible to the gap between theory and practice. In this study, we present a hybrid generative domain adaptation method to turn simulated stellar spectra into realistic spectra, learning from the large spectroscopic surveys. We use a neural network to emulate computationally expensive stellar spectra simulations, and then train a separate unsupervised domain-adaptation network that learns to relate the generated synthetic spectra to observational spectra. Consequently, the network essentially produces data-driven models without the need for a labelled training set. As a proof of concept, two case studies are presented. The first of which is the auto-calibration of synthetic models without using any standard stars. To accomplish this, synthetic models are morphed into spectra that resemble observations, thereby reducing the gap between theory and observations. The second case study is the identification of the elemental source of missing spectral lines in the synthetic modelling. These sources are predicted by interpreting the differences between the domain-adapted and original spectral models. To test our ability to identify missing lines, we use a mock dataset and show that, even with noisy observations, absorption lines can be recovered when they are absent in one of the domains. While we focus on spectral analyses in this study, this method can be applied to other fields, which use large data sets and are currently limited by modelling accuracy. Lastly, the code used in this study is made publicly available on githuba)},

A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity.

The spectroscopically-confirmed components of the proto-cluster are distributed over a \$\{\textbackslash rm 260\textbackslash, kpc \textbackslash times 310\textbackslash, kpc\}\$ region and have a collective obscured star-formation rate (SFR) of \$\textbackslash sim 6500 \textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot \textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm yr\}\^\{-1\}\$, considerably higher than has been seen before in any proto-cluster of galaxies or over-densities of DSFGs at \$z \textbackslash gtrsim 4\$. Most of the star formation is taking place in luminous DSFGs since no Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ emitters are detected in the proto-cluster core, apart from a Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ blob located next to one of the DRC dusty components and extending over \$60\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm kpc\}\$. The total obscured SFR of the proto-cluster could rise to \$\{\textbackslash rm SFR\} \textbackslash sim 14,400 \textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot \textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm yr\}\^\{-1\}\$ if all the members of an over-density of bright DSFGs discovered around DRC in a wide-field LABOCA 870-\$\textbackslash mu\$m image are part of the same structure.

  abstract = {We report results from a large molecular line survey of luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs; L IR {$\greaterequivlnt$}1011L) in the local Universe (z {$\leq$} 0.1), conducted during the last decade with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and the IRAM 30-m telescope. This work presents the CO and 13CO line data for 36 galaxies, further augmented by multi-J total CO line luminosities available for other infrared (IR) bright galaxies from the literature. This yields a combined sample of N = 70 galaxies with the star formation (SF) powered fraction of their IR luminosities spanning L IR {$\sim$}(1010--2\texttimes 1012)L and a wide range of morphologies. Simple comparisons of their available CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) with local ones, as well as radiative transfer models, discern a surprisingly wide range of average interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, with most of the surprises found in the high-excitation regime. These take the form of global CO SLEDs dominated by a very warm (T kin {$\greaterequivlnt$}100K) and dense (n {$\geq$} 10 4cm -3) gas phase, involving galaxy-sized ({$\sim$}(few) \texttimes{} 10 9M {$\odot$}) gas mass reservoirs under conditions that are typically found only for {$\sim$}(1-3) percent of mass per typical SF molecular cloud in the Galaxy. Furthermore, some of the highest excitation CO SLEDs are found in ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs; L IR {$\geq$} 10 12L {$\odot$}) and surpass even those found solely in compact SF-powered hot spots in Galactic molecular clouds. Strong supersonic turbulence and high cosmic ray energy densities rather than far-ultraviolet/optical photons or supernova remnant induced shocks from individual SF sites can globally warm the large amounts of dense gas found in these merger-driven starbursts and easily power their extraordinary CO line excitation. This exciting possibility can now be systematically investigated with Herschel and the Atacama Large Milimeter Array (ALMA). As expected for an IR-selected (and thus SF rate selected) galaxy sample, only few 'cold' CO SLEDs are found, and for fewer still a cold low/moderate-density and gravitationally bound state (i.e. Galactic type) emerges as the most likely one. The rest remain compatible with a warm and gravitationally unbound low-density phase often found in ULIRGs. Such degeneracies, prominent when only the low-J SLED segment (J = 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2) is available, advise against using its CO line ratios and the so-called X co = M(H 2)/L co(1-0) factor as SF mode indicators, a practice that may have led to the misclassification of the ISM environments of IR-selected gas-rich discs in the distant Universe. Finally, we expect that the wide range of ISM conditions found among LIRGs will strongly impact the X co factor, an issue we examine in detail in Paper II. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society \textcopyright{} 2012 RAS.},

Here we extend the Bayesian framework of Patel et al. (2017b) to include all MW satellites with measured 6D phase space information and apply it with the Illustris-Dark simulation to constrain the MW's mass. Using the properties of each MW satellite individually, we find that the scatter among mass estimates is reduced when the magnitude of specific orbital angular momentum (j) is adopted rather than their combined instantaneous positions and velocities. We also find that high j satellites (i.e. Leo II) constrain the upper limits for the MW's mass and low j satellites rather than the highest speed satellites (i.e. Leo I and LMC), set the lower mass limits. When j of all classical satellites is used to simultaneously estimate the MW's mass, we conclude the halo mass is 0.85+0.23/-0.26 \texttimes{} 1012 M{$\odot$} (including Sagittarius dSph) and 0.96+0.29/0.28 \texttimes{} 1012 M{$\odot$} (excluding Sagittarius dSph), cautioning that low j satellites on decaying orbits like Sagittarius dSph may bias the distribution. These estimates markedly reduce the current factor of two spread in the mass range of the MW. We also find a well-defined relationship between host halo mass and satellite j distribution, which yields the prediction that upcoming PMs for ultra-faint dwarfs should reveal j within 5 \texttimes{} 103 - 104 kpc km s-1. This is a promising method to significantly constrain the cosmologically expected mass range for the MW and eventually M31 as more satellite PMs become available.},

However, the effect that galaxy mergers have on star-formation rates (SFRs) is contested, with observations of galaxy mergers showing reduced, enhanced, and highly enhanced star formation. Aims. We aim to determine the effect of galaxy mergers on the SFR of galaxies using statistically large samples of galaxies, totalling over 200 000, which is over a large redshift range from 0.0 to 4.0. Methods. We trained and used convolutional neural networks to create binary merger identifications (merger or non-merger) in the SDSS, KiDS, and CANDELS imaging surveys. We then compared the SFR, with the galaxy main sequence subtracted, of the merging and non-merging galaxies to determine what effect, if any, a galaxy merger has on SFR. Results. We find that the SFR of merging galaxies are not significantly different from the SFR of non-merging systems. The changes in the average SFR seen in the star-forming population when a galaxy is merging are small, of the order of a factor of 1.2. However, the higher the SFR is above the galaxy main sequence, the higher the fraction is for galaxy mergers. Conclusions. Galaxy mergers have little effect on the SFR of the majority of merging galaxies compared to the non-merging galaxies. The typical change in SFR is less than 0.1 dex in either direction. Larger changes in SFR can be seen but are less common. The increase in merger fraction as the distance above the galaxy main sequence increases demonstrates that galaxy mergers can induce starbursts.},

  abstract = {Context . Mergers are an important aspect of galaxy formation and evolution. With large upcoming surveys, such as Euclid and LSST, accurate techniques that are fast and efficient are needed to identify galaxy mergers for further study.  Aims . We aim to test whether deep learning techniques can be used to reproduce visual classification of observations, physical classification of simulations and highlight any differences between these two classifications. As one of the main difficulties of merger studies is the lack of a truth sample, we can use our method to test biases in visually identified merger catalogues.  Methods . We developed a convolutional neural network architecture and trained it in two ways: one with observations from SDSS and one with simulated galaxies from EAGLE, processed to mimic the SDSS observations. The SDSS images were also classified by the simulation trained network and the EAGLE images classified by the observation trained network.  Results . The observationally trained network achieves an accuracy of 91.5\% while the simulation trained network achieves 65.2\% on the visually classified SDSS and physically classified EAGLE images respectively. Classifying the SDSS images with the simulation trained network was less successful, only achieving an accuracy of 64.6\%, while classifying the EAGLE images with the observation network was very poor, achieving an accuracy of only 53.0\% with preferential assignment to the non-merger classification. This suggests that most of the simulated mergers do not have conspicuous merger features and visually identified merger catalogues from observations are incomplete and biased towards certain merger types.  Conclusions . The networks trained and tested with the same data perform the best, with observations performing better than simulations, a result of the observational sample being biased towards conspicuous mergers. Classifying SDSS observations with the simulation trained network has proven to work, providing tantalising prospects for using simulation trained networks for galaxy identification in large surveys.},

Compared to previous studies we have a database that is larger by a factor of 10, as well as reliable distance estimates for almost all stars. Our analysis is based on statistical analysis of a rigorously selected sample of 90 high-velocity halo stars from RAVE and a previously published data set. We calibrated and extensively tested our method using a suite of cosmological simulations of the formation of Milky Way-sized galaxies. Our best estimate of the local Galactic escape speed, which we define as the minimum speed required to reach three virial radii R340, is 533 +54-41533-41+54 km s-1 (90\% confidence), with an additional 4\% systematic uncertainty, where R340 is the Galactocentric radius encompassing a mean overdensity of 340 times the critical density for closure in the Universe. From the escape speed we further derived estimates of the mass of the Galaxy using a simple mass model with two options for the mass profile of the dark matter halo: an unaltered and an adiabatically contracted Navarro, Frenk \& White (NFW) sphere. If we fix the local circular velocity, the latter profile yields a significantly higher mass than the uncontracted halo, but if we instead use the statistics for halo concentration parameters in large cosmological simulations as a constraint, we find very similar masses for both models. Our best estimate for M340, the mass interiorto R340 (dark matter and baryons), is 1.3+0.4-0.3 \texttimes{} 1012 M\^a\v{S}\texttrademark 1.3-0. 3+0.4\texttimes 1012M\^a\v{S}\texttrademark{} (corresponds to M200 = 1.6+0.5-0.4 \texttimes{} 1012M200=1.6-0.4+0. 5\texttimes 1012 M\^a\v{S}\texttrademark ).

At fixed halo mass, we show that disc-like, blue, young, and more massive galaxies are surrounded by significantly steeper stellar haloes than elliptical, red, older, and less massive galaxies. Overall, the stellar density profiles fall off much more steeply than the underlying DM, and no clear trend holds between stellar slope and DM halo concentration. However, DM haloes which formed more recently, or which accreted larger fractions of stellar mass from infalling satellites, exhibit shallower stellar haloes than their older analogues with similar masses, by up to {$\DeltaA$}STARS 0.5-0.7. Our findings, combined with the most recent measurements of the strikingly different stellar power-law indices for M31 and the Milky Way, appear to favour a massive M31, and a Milky Way characterized by a much quieter accretion history over the past 10 Gyr than its companion.},

We use the SDSS spectroscopic catalog to build the local analog and study the evolution of the star formation activity dependence on the environment. At z {$\sim$} 1 we observe a reversal of the relation between star formation rate and local density, confirming the results based on Spitzer 24 {$\mu$}m data. However, due to the high accuracy provided by PACS in measuring the star formation rate also for AGN hosts, we identify in this class of objects the cause for the reversal of the density-SFR relation. Indeed, AGN hosts favor high stellar masses, dense regions and high star formation rates. Without the AGN contribution the relation flattens consistently with respect to the local analog in the same range of star formation rates. As in the local universe, the specific star formation rate anti-correlates with the density. This is due to mass segregation both at high and low redshift. The contribution of AGN hosts does not affect this anti-correlation, since AGN hosts exhibit the same specific star formation rate as star forming galaxies at the same mass. The same global trends and AGN contribution is observed once the relations are studied per morphological type. We study the specific star formation rate vs. stellar mass relation in three density regimes. Our data provides an indication that at M/M{$\odot$} {$>$} 1011 the mean specific star formation rate tends to be higher at higher density, while the opposite trend is observed in the local SDSS star forming sample. \textcopyright{} 2011 ESO.},

  abstract = {High resolution galaxy spectra contain much information about galactic physics, but the high dimensionality of these spectra makes it difficult to fully utilize the information they contain. We apply variational autoencoders (VAEs), a non-linear dimensionality technique, to a sample of spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In contrast to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a widely used technique, VAEs can capture non-linear relationships between latent parameters and the data. We find that a VAE can reconstruct the SDSS spectra well with only six latent parameters, outperforming PCA with the same number of components. Different galaxy classes are naturally separated in this latent space, without class labels having been given to the VAE. The VAE latent space is interpretable because the VAE can be used to make synthetic spectra at any point in latent space. For example, making synthetic spectra along tracks in latent space yields sequences of realistic spectra that interpolate between two different types of galaxies. Using the latent space to find outliers may yield interesting spectra: in our small sample, we immediately find unusual data artifacts and stars misclassified as galaxies. In this exploratory work, we show that VAEs create compact, interpretable latent spaces that capture non-linear features of the data and that VAEs can enable the fast exploration of large astronomical data sets.},

The fraction of merger-affected SF inside the MS seems thus larger than anticipated and might reach \$\textbackslash sim 50\$\textbackslash\% at the highest \$M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\$.

The QSO is a previously known, obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN). The Lya emitting halo appears extended along the direction of the slit and exhibits two faint patches separated by 17 proper kpc in projection from the QSO. Comparison of the two-dimensional spectrum with archival Hubble Space Telescope ACS images shows that these patches coincide spatially with emission from a peculiar, dumbbell-shaped, faint galaxy. The assumptions that the Ly{$\alpha$} emission patches are originating in the galaxy and that the galaxy is physically related to the QSO are at variance with photometric estimates of the galaxy redshift. We show, however, that a population of very young stars at the redshift of the QSO may fit the existing rest-frame broad-band UV photometry of the galaxy. If this scenario is correct, then the symmetry of the galaxy in continuum and Ly{$\alpha$} emission, the extension of the QSO's Ly{$\alpha$} emission in its direction, and the likely presence of a young stellar population in close proximity to a (short-lived) AGN suggest that this may be an example of AGN feedback triggering external star formation in high-redshift galaxies. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

  abstract = {Methods. GSP-Spec estimates the chemo-physical parameters from combined RVS spectra of single stars, without additional inputs from astrometric, photometric, or spectro-photometric BP/RP data. The main analysis workflow described here, MatisseGauguin, is based on projection and optimisation methods and provides the stellar atmospheric parameters; the individual chemical abundances of N, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe i, Fe ii, Ni, Zr, Ce and Nd; the differential equivalent width of a cyanogen line; and the parameters of a diffuse interstellar band (DIB) feature. Another workflow, based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and referred to with the same acronym, provides a second set of atmospheric parameters that are useful for classification control. For both workflows, we implement a detailed quality flag chain considering different error sources. Results. With about 5.6 million stars, the Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec all-sky catalogue is the largest compilation of stellar chemo-physical parameters ever published and the first one from space data. Internal and external biases have been studied taking into account the implemented flags. In some cases, simple calibrations with low degree polynomials are suggested. The homogeneity and quality of the estimated parameters enables chemo-dynamical studies of Galactic stellar populations, interstellar extinction studies from individual spectra, and clear constraints on stellar evolution models. We highly recommend that users adopt the provided quality flags for scientific exploitation. Conclusions. The Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec catalogue is a major step in the scientific exploration of Milky Way stellar populations. It will be followed by increasingly large and higher quality catalogues in future data releases, confirming the Gaia promise of a new Galactic vision.},

  abstract = {The physical origin of enhanced star formation activity in interacting galaxies remains an open question. Knowing whether starbursts are triggered by an increase in the quantity of dense gas or an increase in the star formation efficiency therein would improve our understanding of galaxy evolution and make it possible to transfer the results obtained in the local Universe to high-redshift galaxies. In this paper, we analyze a parsec-resolution simulation of a model of interacting galaxies similar to the Antennae Galaxies. We find that the interplay of physical processes such as tides, shear, and turbulence shows complex and important variations in time and space, but that different combinations of these processes can produce similar signatures in observable quantities such as the depletion time and CO emission. Some clouds within the interacting galaxies exhibit an excess of dense gas ({$>$} 10 4 cm -3 ), while others only attain similarly high densities in the tail of their density distribution. The clouds with an excess of dense gas are found across all regions of the galaxies, but their number density varies between regions due to different cloud assembly mechanisms. This translates into variations in the scale dependence of quantities related to cloud properties and star formation. The super-linearity of the relationship between the star formation rate and gas density implies that the dense gas excess corresponds to a decrease in the depletion time, and thus leads to a deviation from the classical star formation regime that is visible up to galactic scales. We find that the {$\alpha$} CO conversion factor between the CO luminosity and molecular gas mass exhibits stronger spatial than temporal variations in a system like the Antennae. Our results raise several caveats for the interpretation of observations of unresolved star-forming regions, but also predict that the diversity of environments for star formation will be better captured by the future generations of instruments.},

  abstract = {The choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems in variational inference. Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.},

In this work, we apply a recently developed technique, diffusion maps, to astronomical spectra for data parameterization and dimensionality reduction, and develop a robust, eigenmodebased framework for regression. We show how our framework provides a computationally efficient means by which to predict redshifts of galaxies, and thus could inform more expensive redshift estimators such as template cross-correlation. It also provides a natural means by which to identify outliers (e.g., misclassified spectra, spectra with anomalous features). We analyze 3835 Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra and show how our framework yields a more than 95\% reduction in dimensionality. Finally, we show that the prediction error of the diffusion-map-based regression approach is markedly smaller than that of a similar approach based on PCA, clearly demonstrating the superiority of diffusion maps over PCA for this regression task.},

  abstract = {We present high-resolution (0.30{${''}$}) Very Large Array imaging of the molecular gas in the host galaxy of the high-redshift quasar PSS J2322+1944 (z = 4.12). These observations confirm that the molecular gas (CO) in the host galaxy of this quasar is lensed into a full Einstein ring and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system. The ring has a diameter of {$\sim$}1.50{${'}$} and thus is sampled over {$\sim$}20 resolution elements by our observations. Through a model-based lens inversion, we recover the velocity gradient of the molecular reservoir in the quasar host galaxy of PSS J2322+ 1944. The Einstein ring lens configuration enables us to zoom in on the emission and to resolve scales down to {$\lessequivlnt$}1 kpc. From the model-reconstructed source, we find that the molecular gas is distributed on a scale of 5 kpc and has a total mass of M(H2) = 1.7 \texttimes{} 1010 M{$\odot$}. A basic estimate of the dynamical mass gives Mdyn = 4.4 \texttimes{} 1010 sin-2i M{$\odot$}, that is, only {$\sim$}2.5 times the molecular gas mass and {$\sim$}30 times the black hole mass (assuming that the dynamical structure is highly inclined). The lens configuration also allows us to tie the optical emission to the molecular gas emission, which suggests that the active galactic nucleus does reside within, but not close to the center of, the molecular reservoir. Together with the (at least partially) disturbed structure of the CO, this suggests that the system is interacting. Such interaction, possibly caused by a major "wet" merger, may be responsible for both feeding the quasar and fueling the massive starburst of 680 M{$\odot$} yr-1 in this system, in agreement with recently suggested scenarios of quasar activity and galaxy assembly in the early universe. \textcopyright{} 2008.

These observations ultimately confirm the redshift, making AzTEC-3 the most submillimeter-luminous galaxy in a massive z=5.3 protocluster structure in the COSMOS field. The strength of the CO line emission reveals a large molecular gas reservoir with a mass of 5.3e10 (alpha\_CO/0.8) Msun, which can maintain the intense 1800 Msun/yr starburst in this system for at least 30 Myr, increasing the stellar mass by up to a factor of six in the process. This gas mass is comparable to `typical' z\textasciitilde 2 SMGs, and constitutes {$>\sptilde$}80\% of the baryonic mass (gas+stars) and 30\%-80\% of the total (dynamical) mass in this galaxy. The molecular gas reservoir has a radius of {$<$}4 kpc and likely consists of a `diffuse', low-excitation component, containing (at least) 1/3 of the gas mass (depending on the relative conversion factor alpha\_CO), and a `dense', high-excitation component, containing \textasciitilde 2/3 of the mass. The likely presence of a substantial diffuse component besides highly-excited gas suggests different properties between the star-forming environments in z{$>$}4 SMGs and z{$>$}4 quasar host galaxies, which perhaps trace different evolutionary stages. The discovery of a massive, metal-enriched gas reservoir in a SMG at the heart of a large z=5.3 protocluster considerably enhances our understanding of early massive galaxy formation, pushing back to a cosmic epoch where the Universe was less than 1/12 of its present age.},

The strength of the CO line emission reveals molecular gas reservoirs with masses of (4.6 {$\pm$}1.1) \texttimes 108 ({$\mu$}L/32)-1 ({$\alpha$}CO/0.8) M{$\odot$} and (9.3 {$\pm$}1.6) \texttimes{} 108 ({$\mu$}L/28)-1 ({$\alpha$}CO/0.8) M{$\odot$}, respectively. These observations suggest {$\sim$}30\%-40\% larger gas reservoirs than previously estimated based on CO(J = 3\textrightarrow 2) observations due to subthermal excitation of the J = 3 line. These observations also suggest gas mass fractions of 0.46 {$\pm$}0.17 and 0.16 {$\pm$}0.06. The CO(J = 1\textrightarrow 0) emission in the Cosmic Eye is slightly resolved on scales of 4.{${'}$}5 {$\pm$}1. {${'}$}5, consistent with previous studies of nebular emission lines. This suggests that the molecular gas is associated with the most intensely star-forming regions seen in the ultraviolet (UV). We do not resolve the CO(J = 1\textrightarrow 0) emission in cB58 at {$\sim$}2{${'}$}resolution, but find that the CO(J = 1\textrightarrow 0) emission is also consistent with the position of the UV-brightest emission peak. The gas masses, gas fractions, moderate CO line excitation, and star formation efficiencies in these galaxies are consistent with what is found in nearby luminous infrared galaxies. These observations thus currently represent the best constraints on the molecular gas content of "ordinary" (i.e., {$\sim$}L* UV ) z {$\sim$} 3 star-forming galaxies. Despite comparable star formation rates, the gas properties of these young LBGs seem to be different from the recently identified optical/infrared-selected high-z massive, gas-rich star-forming galaxies,which aremore gas-rich and massive, but have lower star formation efficiencies, and presumably trace a different galaxy population. \textcopyright{} 2010 The American Astronomical Society.

The anisotropy profile for the MW satellite system increases from {$\beta$} {$\sim$}-2 at r{$\sim$}20 kpc to {$\beta$} {$\sim$}0.5 at r{$\sim$}200 kpc, indicating that satellites closer to the Galactic centre have tangentially biased motions while those farther out have radially biased motions.

This population reflects the star formation and enrichment in the few most massive progenitor components that coalesced at high redshift to form the proto-Galaxy. While metalpoor stars are known to reside in the inner few kiloparsecs of our Galaxy, current data do not yet provide a comprehensive picture of such a metal-poor ``heart'' of the Milky Way. We use information from Gaia DR3, especially the XP spectra, to construct a sample of 2 million bright (GBP {$<$} 15.5 mag) giant stars within 30{$\smwhtcircle$} of the Galactic Center with robust [M/H] estimates, {$\delta$}[M/H] 0.1. For most sample members we can calculate orbits based on Gaia RVS velocities and astrometry. This sample reveals an extensive, ancient, and metal-poor population that includes {$\sim$} 18, 000 stars with -2.7 {$<$} [M/H] {$<$} -1.5, representing a stellar mass of 5 \texttimes{} 107 M . The spatial distribution of these [M/H] {$<$} -1.5 stars has a Gaussian extent of only {$\sigma$}RGC {$\sim$} 2.7 kpc around the Galactic center, with most of these orbits being confined to the inner Galaxy. At high orbital eccentricities, there is clear evidence for accreted halo stars in their pericentral orbit phase. Stars with [M/H] {$<$} -2 show no net rotation, whereas those with [M/H] {$\sim$} -1 are rotation dominated. Most of the tightly bound stars show [{$\alpha$}/Fe]enhancement and [Al/Fe]\textendash [Mn/Fe] abundance patterns expected for an origin in the more massive portions of the proto-Galaxy. These central, metal-poor stars most likely predate the oldest part of the disk ({$\tau$}age {$\approx$} 12.5 Gyrs), which implies that they formed at z 5, forging the proto-Milky Way.},

Increased use and purchase occur specifically among a sector of consumers who explicitly and disproportionately acknowledge the risks associated with chemical deposition, moreover, and who express concern about the quality of water and human health. What drives the production of monocultural lawns in a period when environmental consciousness has encouraged "green" household action (e.g., recycling)?

Both galaxies have log(\$\{\textbackslash cal M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\}\$/\textbackslash msol)\${$>$}11\$ and are gas rich, with \$\{\textbackslash cal M\}\_\{\textbackslash rm mol\}\$/(\$\{\textbackslash cal M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\}+\{\textbackslash cal M\}\_\{\textbackslash rm mol\}\$)\$\textbackslash sim 0.17-0.45\$. One of these galaxies lies on the star formation rate (SFR)-\$\{\textbackslash cal M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\}\$ sequence while the other lies an order of magnitude below. We compare the cluster galaxies to other SFR-selected galaxies with CO measurements and find that they have CO luminosities consistent with expectations given their infrared luminosities. We also find that they have comparable gas fractions and star formation efficiencies (SFE) to what is expected from published field galaxy scaling relations. The galaxies are compact in their stellar light distribution, at the extreme end for all high redshift star-forming galaxies. However, their SFE is consistent with other field galaxies at comparable compactness. This is similar to two other sources selected in a blind CO survey of the HDF-N. Despite living in a highly quenched proto-cluster core, the molecular gas properties of these two galaxies, one of which may be in the processes of quenching, appear entirely consistent with field scaling relations between the molecular gas content, stellar mass, star formation rate, and redshift. We speculate that these cluster galaxies cannot have any further substantive gas accretion if they are to become members of the dominant passive population in \$z{$<$}1\$ clusters.},

  abstract = {We present SR3, an approach to image Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement. SR3 adapts denoising diffusion probabilistic models to conditional image generation and performs super-resolution through a stochastic denoising process. Inference starts with pure Gaussian noise and iteratively refines the noisy output using a U-Net model trained on denoising at various noise levels. SR3 exhibits strong performance on super-resolution tasks at different magnification factors, on faces and natural images. We conduct human evaluation on a standard 8X face super-resolution task on CelebA-HQ, comparing with SOTA GAN methods. SR3 achieves a fool rate close to 50\%, suggesting photo-realistic outputs, while GANs do not exceed a fool rate of 34\%. We further show the effectiveness of SR3 in cascaded image generation, where generative models are chained with super-resolution models, yielding a competitive FID score of 11.3 on ImageNet.},

We present new observations for a sample of 17 lensed galaxies at z = 1.4-3.1, which allow us to directly probe the cold interstellar medium of normal star-forming galaxies with stellar masses of {$\sim$}1010 M {$\odot$}, a regime otherwise not (yet) accessible by individual detections in Herschel and molecular gas studies. The lensed galaxies are combined with reference samples of submillimeter and normal z {$\sim$} 1-2 star-forming galaxies with similar far-infrared photometry to study the gas and dust properties of galaxies in the SFR-M *-redshift parameter space. The mean gas depletion timescale of main-sequence (MS) galaxies at z {$>$} 2 is measured to be only {$\sim$}450 Myr, a factor of {$\sim$}1.5 ({$\sim$}5) shorter than at z = 1 (z = 0), in agreement with a (1 + z)-1 scaling. The mean gas mass fraction at z = 2.8 is 40\% {$\pm$} 15\% (44\% after incompleteness correction), suggesting a flattening or even a reversal of the trend of increasing gas fractions with redshift recently observed up to z {$\sim$} 2. The depletion timescale and gas fractions of the z {$>$} 2 normal star-forming galaxies can be explained under the "equilibrium model" for galaxy evolution, in which the gas reservoir of galaxies is the primary driver of the redshift evolution of specific star formation rates. Due to their high star formation efficiencies and low metallicities, the z {$>$} 2 lensed galaxies have warm dust despite being located on the star formation MS. At fixed metallicity, they also have a gas-to-dust ratio 1.7 times larger than observed locally when using the same standard techniques, suggesting that applying the local calibration of the {$\delta$}GDR-metallicity relation to infer the molecular gas mass of high-redshift galaxies may lead to systematic differences with CO-based estimates. \textcopyright{} 2013.

For the GZ2 type questions, our models have large accuracy ({$>$} 97 per cent), precision and recall values ({$>$} 90 per cent), when applied to a test sample with the same characteristics as the one used for training.

This new phase-space view of our Galaxy demands new tools for comparing observations to simulations of Milky-Way-mass galaxies in a cosmological context, to test the physics of both dark matter and galaxy formation. We present ananke, a framework for generating synthetic phase-space surveys from high-resolution baryonic simulations, and use it to generate a suite of synthetic surveys resembling Gaia DR2 in data structure, magnitude limits, and observational errors. We use three cosmological simulations of Milky-Way-mass galaxies from the Latte suite of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, which feature self-consistent clustering of star formation in dense molecular clouds and thin stellar/gaseous disks in live cosmological halos with satellite dwarf galaxies and stellar halos. We select three solar viewpoints from each simulation to generate nine synthetic Gaia-like surveys. We sample synthetic stars by assuming each star particle (of mass 7070 \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) represents a single stellar population. At each viewpoint, we compute dust extinction from the simulated gas metallicity distribution and apply a simple error model to produce a synthetic Gaia-like survey that includes both observational properties and a pointer to the generating star particle. We provide the complete simulation snapshot at \$z = 0\$ for each simulated galaxy. We describe data access points, the data model, and plans for future upgrades. These synthetic surveys provide a tool for the scientific community to test analysis methods and interpret Gaia data.},

  abstract = {We present {$\sim$}kiloparsec spatial resolution maps of the CO-to-H 2 conversion factor ({$\alpha$}CO) and dust-to-gas ratio (DGR) in 26 nearby, star-forming galaxies. We have simultaneously solved for {$\alpha$}CO and the DGR by assuming that the DGR is approximately constant on kiloparsec scales. With this assumption, we can combine maps of dust mass surface density, CO-integrated intensity, and H I column density to solve for both {$\alpha$}CO and the DGR with no assumptions about their value or dependence on metallicity or other parameters. Such a study has just become possible with the availability of high-resolution far-IR maps from the Herschel key program KINGFISH, 12CO J = (2-1) maps from the IRAM 30 m large program HERACLES, and H I 21 cm line maps from THINGS. We use a fixed ratio between the (2-1) and (1-0) lines to present our {$\alpha$}CO results on the more typically used 12CO J = (1-0) scale and show using literature measurements that variations in the line ratio do not affect our results. In total, we derive 782 individual solutions for {$\alpha$}CO and the DGR. On average, {$\alpha$}CO = 3.1 M{\. } pc -2 (K km s-1)-1 for our sample with a standard deviation of 0.3 dex. Within galaxies, we observe a generally flat profile of {$\alpha$}CO as a function of galactocentric radius. However, most galaxies exhibit a lower {$\alpha$}CO value in the central kiloparsec - a factor of {$\sim$}2 below the galaxy mean, on average. In some cases, the central {$\alpha$}CO value can be factors of 5-10 below the standard Milky Way (MW) value of {$\alpha$}CO, MW = 4.4 M {$\odot$} pc-2 (K km s-1)-1. While for {$\alpha$}CO we find only weak correlations with metallicity, the DGR is well-correlated with metallicity, with an approximately linear slope. Finally, we present several recommendations for choosing an appropriate {$\alpha$}CO for studies of nearby galaxies. \textcopyright{} 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

  abstract = {Star-forming galaxies (SFGs) display a continuous specific star formation rate (sSFR) distribution, which can be approximated by two log-normal functions: one encompassing the galaxy main sequence (MS), and the other a rarer, starbursting population. Starburst (SB) sSFRs can be regarded as the outcome of a physical process (plausibly merging) taking the mathematical form of a log-normal boosting kernel that enhances star formation activity. We explore the utility of splitting the star-forming population into MS and SB galaxies - an approach we term the "2-Star Formation Mode" framework - for understanding their molecular gas properties. Star formation efficiency (SFE) and gas fraction variations among SFGs take a simple redshift-independent form, once these quantities are normalized to the corresponding values for average MS galaxies. SFE enhancements during SB episodes scale supra-linearly with the SFR increase, as expected for mergers. Consequently, galaxies separate more clearly into loci for SBs and normal galaxies in the Schmidt-Kennicutt plane than in (s)SFR versus M space. SBs with large deviations ({$>$}10 fold) from the MS, e.g., local ULIRGs, are not average SBs, but are much rarer events whose progenitors had larger gas fractions than typical MS galaxies. Statistically, gas fractions in SBs are reduced two- to threefold compared to their direct MS progenitors, as expected for short-lived SFR boosts where internal gas reservoirs are depleted more quickly than gas is re-accreted from the cosmic web. We predict variations of the conversion factor {$\alpha$}COin the SFR-M plane and we show that the higher sSFR of distant galaxies is directly related to their larger gas fractions.},

It is concluded that the divalent ions remain atomically dispersed in KCl when the crystal is quenched to room temperature from elevated temperatures, whereas some of the divalent ions and their associated positive-ion vacancies migrate to F-centers during the quenching process in NaCl. The observations also suggest that the divalent ions are not very mobile in KCl until a temperature near 200\textdegree C is attained, although the pair consisting of a positive and a negative ion vacancy becomes significantly mobile in the vicinity of 100\textdegree C. A number of experiments are proposed which may provide a more stringent test of the models suggested. \textcopyright{} 1951 The American Physical Society.},

This review of such slow changes is largely, though not entirely, restricted to internally driven processes that can be distinguished from evolution driven by galaxy interactions. It both describes our current understanding of disk evolution and identifies areas where more work is needed. Stellar disks are heated through spiral scattering, which increases random motion components in the plane, while molecular clouds redirect some fraction of the random energy into vertical motion. The recently discovered process of radial migration at the corotation resonance of a transient spiral mode does not alter the underlying structure of the disk, since it neither heats the disk nor causes it to spread, but it does have a profound effect on the expected distribution of metallicities among the disk stars. Bars in disks are believed to be major drivers of secular evolution through interactions with the outer disk and with the halo. Once the material that makes up galaxy disks is converted into stars, their overall angular momentum distribution cannot change by much, but that of the gas is generally far more liable to rearrangement, allowing rings and pseudobulges to form. While simulations are powerful tools from which we have learned a great deal, those of disks may suffer from collisional relaxation that requires some results to be interpreted with caution. \textcopyright{} 2014 American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {Context: As of today, hundreds of hot Jupiters have been found, yet the inflated radii of a large fraction of them remain unexplained. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain these anomalous radii, however most of these can only work under certain conditions and may not be sufficient to explain the most extreme cases. It is still unclear whether a single mechanism can sufficiently explain the entire distribution of radii, or whether a combination of these mechanisms is needed. Aims. We seek to understand the relationship of radius with stellar irradiation and mass and to find the range of masses over which hot Jupiters are inflated. We also aim to find the intrinsic physical scatter in their radii, caused by unobservable parameters, and to constrain the fraction of hot Jupiters that exhibit inflation. Methods. By constructing a hierarchical Bayesian model, we inferred the probabilistic relation between planet radius, mass, and incident flux for a sample of 286 gas giants. We separately incorporated the observational uncertainties of the data and the intrinsic physical scatter in the population. This allowed us to treat the intrinsic physical scatter in radii, due to latent parameters such as the heavy element fraction, as a parameter to be inferred. Results. We find that the planetary mass plays a key role in the inflation extent and that planets in the range {$\sim$}0.37-0.98 MJ show the most inflated radii. At higher masses, the radius response to incident flux begins to decrease. Below a threshold of 0.37 {$\pm$} 0.03 MJ we find that giant exoplanets as a population are unable to maintain inflated radii '1.4 RJ but instead exhibit smaller sizes as the incident flux is increased beyond 106 W m-2. We also find that below 1 MJ, there is a cut-off point at high incident flux beyond which we find no more inflated planets, and that this cut-off point decreases as the mass decreases. At incident fluxes higher than {$\sim$}1.6 \texttimes{} 106 W m-2 and in a mass range 0.37-0.98 MJ, we find no evidence for a population of non-inflated hot Jupiters. Our study sheds a fresh light on one of the key questions in the field and demonstrates the importance of population-level analysis to grasp the underlying properties of exoplanets.},

We show how parallel translation can be used to generate analogies, i.e., to transport a change in one data point into a semantically similar change of another data point. Our experiments on real image data show that the manifolds learned by deep generative models, while nonlinear, are surprisingly close to zero curvature. The practical implication is that linear paths in the latent space closely approximate geodesics on the generated manifold.},

  abstract = {The epoch of galaxy assembly from 2{$<$}=z{$<$}=4 marks a critical stage during the evolution of today's galaxy population. During this period the star-formation activity in the Universe was at its peak level, and the structural patterns observed among galaxies in the local Universe were not yet in place. A variety of novel techniques have been employed over the past decade to assemble multiwavelength observations of galaxies during this important epoch. In this primarily observational review, I present a census of the methods used to find distant galaxies and the empirical constraints on their multiwavelength luminosities and colors. I then discuss what is known about the stellar content and past histories of star formation in high-redshift galaxies; their interstellar contents including dust, gas, and heavy elements; and their structural and dynamical properties. I conclude by considering some of the most pressing and open questions regarding the physics of high-redshift galaxies, which are to be addressed with future facilities.},

  abstract = {Most molecular gas studies of \$z {$>$} 2.5\$ galaxies are of intrinsically bright objects, despite the galaxy population being primarily "normal" galaxies with less extreme star formation rates. Observations of normal galaxies at high redshift provide a more representative view of galaxy evolution and star formation, but such observations are challenging to obtain. In this work, we present ALMA \$\textbackslash rm \^\{12\}CO(J = 3 \textbackslash rightarrow 2)\$ observations of a sub-millimeter selected galaxy group at \$z = 2.9\$, resulting in spectroscopic confirmation of seven images from four member galaxies. These galaxies are strongly lensed by the MS 0451.6-0305 foreground cluster at \$z = 0.55\$, allowing us to probe the molecular gas content on levels of \$\textbackslash rm 10\^9-10\^\{10\} \textbackslash; M\_\textbackslash odot\$. Four detected galaxies have molecular gas masses of \$\textbackslash rm (0.2-13.1) \textbackslash times 10\^\{10\} \textbackslash; M\_\textbackslash odot\$, and the non-detected galaxies have inferred molecular gas masses of \$\textbackslash rm {$<$} 8.0 \textbackslash times 10\^\{10\} \textbackslash; M\_\textbackslash odot\$. We compare these new data to a compilation of 546 galaxies up to \$z = 5.3\$, and find that depletion times decrease with increasing redshift. We then compare the depletion times of galaxies in overdense environments to the field scaling relation from the literature, and find that the depletion time evolution is steeper for galaxies in overdense environments than for those in the field. More molecular gas measurements of normal galaxies in overdense environments at higher redshifts (\$z {$>$} 2.5\$) are needed to verify the environmental dependence of star formation and gas depletion.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The mass of the Milky Way is a critical quantity that, despite decades of research, remains uncertain within a factor of two. Until recently, most studies have used dynamical tracers in the inner regions of the halo, relying on extrapolations to estimate the mass of the Milky Way. In this paper, we extend the hierarchical Bayesian model applied in Eadie \& Juri to study the mass distribution of the Milky Way halo; the new model allows for the use of all available 6D phase-space measurements. We use kinematic data of halo stars out to 142 kpc, obtained from the H3 survey and Gaia EDR3, to infer the mass of the Galaxy. Inference is carried out with the No-U-Turn sampler, a fast and scalable extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We report a median mass enclosed within 100 kpc of                                                                                                        M                   (                   {$<$}                   100                                      kpc                   )                   =                                                               0.69                                                                 -                       0.04                                                                 +                       0.05                                                           \texttimes{}                                                               10                                                                 12                                                                                                                          M                                                                 {$\odot$}                                                                                                        (68\% Bayesian credible interval), or a virial mass of                                                                                                                                                    M                                                                 200                                                           =                   M                   (                   {$<$}                                                               216.2                                                                 -                       7.5                                                                 +                       7.5                                                                              kpc                   )                   =                                                               1.08                                                                 -                       0.11                                                                 +                       0.12                                                           \texttimes{}                                                               10                                                                 12                                                                                                                          M                                                                 {$\odot$}                                                                                                        , in good agreement with other recent estimates.

This article contributes to this growing literature, but in contrast to much research, it examines human-nature relations in the patios (garden) of homes in a marginalized barrio (slum) of Managua, Nicaragua. I suggest that the human-nature relations in these patios need to be understood differently than those in North American and European gardens. Based on research carried out in Managua, I argue that such relations are at the centre of everyday domestic activities and are critical in producing home as a liveable space in the city. The article draws on feminist geographic understandings of home and current work around human-environment relations, and identifies three different sets of socio-ecological relations: corporeal, aesthetic and economic. It argues that these three different relations between humans and the plants and trees in their patios are critical in the imaginaries around home and in the production of habitable spaces in cities, as well as to our understanding of urban natures.},

These protoclusters are promising candidates for the most massive class of galaxy clusters seen today (Paper I). The confirmed HAEs in the protoclusters at z {$>$} 2 show high excitation levels as characterized by much higher [O III]/H{$\beta$} or [O III]/H{$\alpha$} line ratios than those of general galaxies at low-z. Such a high excitation level may not only be driven by high specific star formation rates and lower gaseous metallicities, but also be contributed by some other effects. We investigate the environmental dependence of gaseous metallicities by comparing the HAEs in the protoclustrers with those in the general field at similar redshifts.We find that the gaseous metallicities of protocluster galaxies are more chemically enriched than those of field galaxies at a given stellar mass in the range of M* {$\lessequivlnt$} 1011M{$\odot$}. This can be attributed to many processes, such as intrinsic (or nature) effects, external (or nurture) effects, and/or some systematic sampling effects. The intrinsic (nature) effect leads to the advanced stage of 'downsizing' galaxy evolution in protoclusters. On the other hand, the external (nurture) effects include the recycling of chemically enriched gas due to the higher pressure of intergalactic medium and/or stripping of outer gas in the reservoir in protoclusters.We also find that the offset of the mass-metallicity relation in dense environment becomes larger at higher redshifts. This can be naturally understood by the fact that the inflow/outflow rates in star-forming galaxies are much higher at higher redshifts. Therefore, the environmental dependence of such 'feeding' and 'feedback' mechanisms in galaxy formation is probably playing major roles in producing the offset of the mass-metallicity relation for the protocluster galaxies at z {$>$} 2.},

  abstract = {Although there is widespread concern over degrading marine environments, there is debate within the global marine conservation agenda about the nature of the problem and appropriate solutions. At the center of this debate lie questions about the appropriate scale at which to plan and implement marine resource management. In the late 1990s, Fiji became recognized as one of the most successful examples of community-based marine resource management in the world. Recently, there has been a move to manage human-environment interactions at larger "natural" scales. We draw from the political ecology and "politics of scale" literatures, and a critical realist understanding of nature and politics, to explain the emergence of large-scale management and conservation in Fiji. We contribute to a "political ecology of scale" by developing the concept of a scalar narrative to show how social and ecological scales are reworked in the development of an ecosystem-based approach to marine management in Fiji. In doing so, we consider implications of the struggle to define the appropriate scale of marine management, which is closely bound to debates about the role of science and local participation. Our findings suggest that the struggle to define the scale at which marine management should be planned and implemented is inseparable from the struggle over who should define, inform, and conduct the governance process. We aim to clarify marine policy debates as policy actors worldwide move forward to implement ecosystem-based management, increase marine protected area coverage, and pursue sustainable development. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In this paper we address the numerical solution of minimal norm residuals of nonlinear equations in finite dimensions. We take particularly inspiration from the problem of finding a sparse vector solution of phase retrieval problems by using greedy algorithms based on iterative residual minimizations in the p-norm, for 1 {$\leq$} p {$\leq$} 2. Due to the mild smoothness of the problem, especially for p \textrightarrow{} 1, we develop and analyze a generalized version of iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS). This simple and efficient algorithm performs the solution of optimization problems involving non-quadratic possibly non-convex and non-smooth cost functions, which can be transformed into a sequence of common least squares problems. The latter can be tackled eventually by more efficient numerical optimization methods. While its analysis has been by now developed in many different contexts (e.g., for sparse vector, low-rank matrix optimization, and for the solution of PDE involving p-Laplacians) when the model equation is linear, no results are up to now provided in case of nonlinear ones. We address here precisely the convergence and the rate of error decay of IRLS for such nonlinear problems. The analysis of the convergence of the algorithm is based on its reformulation as an alternating minimization of an energy functional. In fact its main variables are the competitors to solutions of the intermediate reweighted least squares problems and their weights. Under a specific condition of coercivity often verified in practice and assumptions of local convexity, we are able to show convergence of IRLS to minimizers of the nonlinear residual problem. For the case where we are lacking the local convexity, we propose an appropriate convexification by quadratic perturbations. Eventually we are able to show convergence of this modified procedure to at least a very good approximation of stationary points of the original problem. In 123 756 J. Sigl order to illustrate the theoretical results we conclude the paper with several numerical experiments. We first compare IRLS with standard Matlab optimization functions for a simple and easily presentable example. Furthermore we numerically validate our theoretical results in the more complicated framework of phase retrieval problems, which are our main motivation. Finally we examine the recovery capability of the algorithm in the context of data corrupted by impulsive noise where the sparsification of the residual is desired.},

Inclusion of active galactic nucleus (AGN) induced pressure, by jets and/or winds that flow back onto a gas-rich disk, can lead, under some circumstances, to significantly enhanced star formation rates, especially at high redshift and most likely followed by the more widely accepted phase of star formation quenching. Simple expressions are derived that relate supermassive black hole growth, star formation, and outflow rates. The ratios of black hole to spheroid mass and of both black hole accretion and outflow rates to star formation rate are predicted as a function of time.

The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the "nested"contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values.

  abstract = {We use extensive gravity-sensitive DDO 51 photometry over 5100 square degrees, combined with SDSS broadband photometry, to select a catalog of \$\textbackslash sim 4,000\$ giant stars covering a large fraction of the high Galactic latitude sky and reaching out to \$\textbackslash sim 80\$ kpc in the Galactic halo. This sample of bright and unbiased tracers enables us to measure the radial profile and 3D structure of the stellar halo to large distance which had previously only been measured with sparse tracers or small samples. Using population synthesis models to reproduce the observed giant star luminosity function, we find that the halo maintains a \$r\^\{-3.5\}\$ profile from \$30\$ to \$80\$ kpc with no signs of a truncation or sharp break over this range. The radial profile measurement is largely insensitive to individual halo substructure components, but we find that attempting to measure the shape of the halo is overwhelmed by the Sagittarius stream such that no ellipsoidal shape is a satisfactory description in this region. These measurements allow us to begin placing the Milky Way in context with the growing sample of external galaxies where similar halo profile measurements are available, with the goal of further linking the properties of stellar halos to the accretion histories that formed them.},

  abstract = {New mass estimates and cumulative mass profiles with Bayesian credible regions (c.r.) for the Milky Way (MW) are found using the Galactic Mass Estimator (GME) code and dwarf galaxy (DG) kinematic data from multiple sources. GME takes a hierarchical Bayesian approach to simultaneously estimate the true positions and velocities of the DGs, their velocity anisotropy, and the model parameters for the Galaxy's total gravitational potential. In this study, we incorporate meaningful prior information from past studies and simulations. The prior distributions for the physical model are informed by the results of Eadie \& Juri\textasciiacute c (2019), which used globular clusters instead of DGs, as well as by the subhalo distributions of the Ananke Gaia-like surveys from Feedback In Realistic Environments-2 (Fire-2) cosmological simulations (see Sanderson et al. 2020). Using DGs beyond 45 kpc, we report median and 95\% c.r estimates for r200 = 212.8 (191.12,238.44) kpc, and for the total enclosed mass M200 = 1.19 (0.87,1.68)\texttimes 1012M (adopting {$\increment$}c = 200). Median mass estimates at specific radii are also reported (e.g., M ({$<$} 50 kpc) = 0.52 \texttimes{} 1012M and M (100 kpc) = 0.78 \texttimes{} 1012M ). Estimates are comparable to other recent studies using Gaia DR2 and DGs, but notably different from the estimates of Eadie \& Juri\textasciiacute c (2019). We perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate whether individual DGs and/or a more massive Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) on the order of 1011M may be affecting our mass estimates. We find possible supporting evidence for the idea that some DGs are affected by a massive LMC and are not in equilibrium with the MW.},

We use cosmological simulations of disc galaxy formation to motivate our assumptions on the shape of the velocity distribution, allowing for a significantly more precise measurement of the escape velocity compared to previous studies. We find that the escape velocity lies within the range 498 {$<$} vesc {$<$} 608 km s-1 (90 per cent confidence), with a median likelihood of 544 km s-1. The fact that v2esc is significantly greater than 2v2circ (where vcirc = 220 km s-1 is the local circular velocity) implies that there must be a significant amount of mass exterior to the solar circle, that is, this convincingly demonstrates the presence of a dark halo in the Galaxy. We use our constraints on vesc to determine the mass of the Milky Way halo for three halo profiles. For example, an adiabatically contracted NFW halo model results in a virial mass of 1.42+1.14-0.54 \texttimes{} 1012 M{$\odot$} and virial radius of (90 per cent confidence). For this model the circular velocity at the virial radius is 142+31-21 km s-1. Although our halo masses are model dependent, we find that they are in good agreement with each other. \textcopyright{} 2007 RAS.},

We prove that for sufficiently small learning rates, if the model predictions on the training set approach the true conditional distribution of labels given inputs, the stationary distribution of minibatch NGD approaches a Bayesian posterior near local minima. The temperature T = {$\epsilon$}N=(2B) is controlled by the learning rate , training set size N and batch size B. However minibatch NGD is not parameterisation invariant and it does not sample a valid posterior away from local minima. We therefore propose a novel optimiser, "stochastic NGD", which introduces the additional correction terms required to preserve both properties.},

This review presents a summary of the available techniques for age-dating stars and ensembles of stars, their realms of applicability, and their strengths and weaknesses. My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve when stressed by better observations.},

This is achieved using Markov chain transitions that satisfy the fixed point equation, but do not satisfy detailed balance. The resulting algorithm significantly suppresses the random walk behavior and wasted function evaluations that are typically the consequence of update rejection. We demonstrate a greater than factor of two improvement in mixing time on three test problems. We release the source code as Python and MATLAB packages.},

Young and old halo GCs do not show systematic differences in their 3D Galactocentric velocities, derived from combination with existing line-of-sight velocities.

The CO(6 yields 5) line traces warm molecular gas, which is found in the Milky Way only in regions of high-mass star formation. The molecular gas in 10214 + 4724 is warm and dense with n(H2) is about 5000/cu cm if T(kin) = 50 K. The total mass of molecular hydrogen is 1 x 10 exp 11/sq h solar masses. Although this is about 200 times less mass than initially estimated by Brown and VandenBout (1991), it is still 3-5 times larger than the molecular mass of any other galaxy yet observed and 60/sq h more than the H2 mass of the Milky Way. A starburst can power 10214 + 4724 only if predominantly high-mass stars are produced. This extraordinary primeval galaxy has most of its mass in molecular gas, has already collapsed, and is undergoing an extreme starburst that is generating metals in abundances close to solar.},

Because gradients can be ill-defined and hard to estimate when the data resides on low-dimensional manifolds, we perturb the data with different levels of Gaussian noise, and jointly estimate the corresponding scores, i.e., the vector fields of gradients of the perturbed data distribution for all noise levels. For sampling, we propose an annealed Langevin dynamics where we use gradients corresponding to gradually decreasing noise levels as the sampling process gets closer to the data manifold. Our framework allows flexible model architectures, requires no sampling during training or the use of adversarial methods, and provides a learning objective that can be used for principled model comparisons. Our models produce samples comparable to GANs on MNIST, CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art inception score of 8.87 on CIFAR-10. Additionally, we demonstrate that our models learn effective representations via image inpainting experiments.},

  abstract = {Creating noise from data is easy; creating data from noise is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (a.k.a., score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of 1024 \textasciicircum{} 1024 images for the first time from a score-based generative model.},

Strong lensing allows us to probe the structure and dynamics of the molecular gas in these two objects, at z=2.78 and z=5.66, with effective source-plane resolution of less than 1kpc. We model the lensed emission from multiple CO transitions and the dust continuum in a consistent manner, finding that the cold molecular gas as traced by low-J CO always has a larger half-light radius than the 870um dust continuum emission. This size difference leads to up to 50\% differences in the magnification factor for the cold gas compared to dust. In the z=2.78 galaxy, these CO observations confirm that the background source is undergoing a major merger, while the velocity field of the other source is more complex. We use the ATCA CO observations and comparable resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array dust continuum imaging of the same objects to constrain the CO-H\_2 conversion factor with three different procedures, finding good agreement between the methods and values consistent with those found for rapidly star-forming systems. We discuss these galaxies in the context of the star formation - gas mass surface density relation, noting that the change in emitting area with observed CO transition must be accounted for when comparing high-redshift galaxies to their lower redshift counterparts.},

  abstract = {We have surveyed the core regions of the z = 1.46 cluster XCS J2215.9-1738 with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the MUSE-GALACSI spectrograph on the VLT. We obtained high spatial resolution observations with ALMA of the 1.2 mm dust continuum and molecular gas emission in the central regions of the cluster. These observations detect 14 significant millimetre sources in a region with a projected diameter of just \textasciitilde 500kpc (\textasciitilde 1'). For six of these galaxies we also obtain 12 CO(2-1) and 12 CO(5-4) line detections, confirming them as cluster members, and a further five of our millimetre galaxies have archival 12CO(2-1) detections which also place them in the cluster. An additional two millimetre galaxies have photometric redshifts consistent with cluster membership, although neither show strong line emission in the MUSE spectra. This suggests that the bulk ({$>$} 11/14, \textasciitilde 80\%) of the submillimetre sources in the field are in fact luminous infrared galaxies lying within this young cluster. We then use our sensitive new observations to constrain the dust-obscured star formation activity and cold molecular gas within this cluster. We find hints that the cooler dust and gas components within these galaxies may have been influenced by their environment reducing the gas reservoir available for their subsequent star formation. We also find that these actively star- forming galaxies have the dynamical masses and stellar population ages expected for the progenitors of massive, early-type galaxies in local clusters potentially linking these populations.},

  abstract = {Many animals have the potential to discriminate nonspectral colors. For humans, purple is the clearest example of a nonspectral color. It is perceived when two color cone types in the retina (blue and red) with nonadjacent spectral sensitivity curves are predominantly stimulated. Purple is considered nonspectral because no monochromatic light (such as from a rainbow) can evoke this simultaneous stimulation. Except in primates and bees, few behavioral experiments have directly examined nonspectral color discrimination, and little is known about nonspectral color perception in animals with more than three types of color photoreceptors. Birds have four color cone types (compared to three in humans) and might perceive additional nonspectral colors such as UV+red and UV+green. Can birds discriminate nonspectral colors, and are these colors behaviorally and ecologically relevant Here, using comprehensive behavioral experiments, we show that wild hummingbirds can discriminate a variety of nonspectral colors. We also show that hummingbirds, relative to humans, likely perceive a greater proportion of natural colors as nonspectral. Our analysis of plumage and plant spectra reveals many colors that would be perceived as nonspectral by birds but not by humans: Birds' extra cone type allows them not just to see UV light but also to discriminate additional nonspectral colors. Our results support the idea that birds can distinguish colors throughout tetrachromatic color space and indicate that nonspectral color perception is vital for signaling and foraging. Since tetrachromacy appears to have evolved early in vertebrates, this capacity for rich nonspectral color perception is likely widespread.},

The new data reveal for the first time spatially resolved CO gas kinematics in the observed SMGs. Two of the SMGs show double or multiple morphologies, with complex, disturbed gas motions. The other two SMGs exhibit CO velocity gradients of \textasciitilde 500 km s-1 across \&lt;=0.2" (1.6 kpc) diameter regions, suggesting that the star-forming gas is in compact, rotating disks. Our data provide compelling evidence that these SMGs represent extreme, short-lived ``maximum'' star-forming events in highly dissipative mergers of gas-rich galaxies. The resulting high-mass surface and volume densities of SMGs are similar to those of compact quiescent galaxies in the same redshift range and much higher than those in local spheroids. From the ratio of the comoving volume densities of SMGs and quiescent galaxies in the same mass and redshift ranges, and from the comparison of gas exhaustion timescales and stellar ages, we estimate that the SMG phase duration is about 100 Myr. Our analysis of SMGs and optically/UV selected high-redshift star-forming galaxies supports a ``universal'' Chabrier IMF as being valid over the star-forming history of these galaxies. We find that the 12CO luminosity to total gas mass conversion factors at z\textasciitilde 2-3 are probably similar to those assumed at z\textasciitilde 0.

  abstract = {We present PHIBSS, the IRAM Plateau de Bure high-z blue sequence CO 3-2 survey of the molecular gas properties in massive, main-sequence star-forming galaxies (SFGs) near the cosmic star formation peak. PHIBSS provides 52 CO detections in two redshift slices at z {$\sim$} 1.2 and 2.2, with log(M * (M{$\odot$})) {$\geq$} 10.4 and log(SFR(M {$\odot$}/yr)) {$\geq$} 1.5. Including a correction for the incomplete coverage of the M* -SFR plane, and adopting a "Galactic" value for the CO-H2 conversion factor, we infer average gas fractions of {$\sim$}0.33 at z {$\sim$} 1.2 and {$\sim$}0.47 at z {$\sim$} 2.2. Gas fractions drop with stellar mass, in agreement with cosmological simulations including strong star formation feedback. Most of the z {$\sim$} 1-3 SFGs are rotationally supported turbulent disks. The sizes of CO and UV/optical emission are comparable. The molecular-gas-star-formation relation for the z = 1-3 SFGs is near-linear, with a {$\sim$}0.7 Gyr gas depletion timescale; changes in depletion time are only a secondary effect. Since this timescale is much less than the Hubble time in all SFGs between z {$\sim$} 0 and 2, fresh gas must be supplied with a fairly high duty cycle over several billion years. At given z and M *, gas fractions correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate (sSFR). The variation of sSFR between z {$\sim$} 0 and 3 is mainly controlled by the fraction of baryonic mass that resides in cold gas. \textcopyright{} 2013. The American Astronomical Society.

  abstract = {This paper provides an update of our previous scaling relations (Genzel et al.2015) between galaxy integrated molecular gas masses, stellar masses and star formation rates, in the framework of the star formation main-sequence (MS), with the main goal to test for possible systematic effects. For this purpose our new study combines three independent methods of determining molecular gas masses from CO line fluxes, far-infrared dust spectral energy distributions, and \textasciitilde 1mm dust photometry, in a large sample of 1444 star forming galaxies (SFGs) between z=0 and 4. The sample covers the stellar mass range log(M*/M\_solar)=9.0-11.8, and star formation rates relative to that on the MS, delta\_MS=SFR/SFR(MS), from 10\^\{-1.3\} to 10\^\{2.2\}. Our most important finding is that all data sets, despite the different techniques and analysis methods used, follow the same scaling trends, once method-to-method zero point offsets are minimized and uncertainties are properly taken into account. The molecular gas depletion time t\_depl, defined as the ratio of molecular gas mass to star formation rate, scales as (1+z)\^\{-0.6\}x(delta\_MS)\^\{-0.44\}, and is only weakly dependent on stellar mass. The ratio of molecular-to-stellar mass mu\_gas depends on (1+z)\^\{2.5\}x (delta\_MS)\^\{0.52\}x(M*)\^\{-0.36\}, which tracks the evolution of the specific star formation rate. The redshift dependence of mu\_gas requires a curvature term, as may the mass-dependences of t\_depl and mu\_gas. We find no or only weak correlations of t\_depl and mu\_gas with optical size R or surface density once one removes the above scalings, but we caution that optical sizes may not be appropriate for the high gas and dust columns at high-z.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, increasingly robust estimates of the dense molecular gas content in galaxy populations between redshift z = 0 and the peak of cosmic galaxy/star formation ( z {$\sim$} 1\textendash 3) have become available. This rapid progress has been possible due to the advent of powerful ground- and space-based telescopes for the combined study of several millimeter to far-IR, line or continuum tracers of the molecular gas and dust components. The main conclusions of this review are as follows: {$\blacksquare$} Star-forming galaxies contained much more molecular gas at earlier cosmic epochs than at the present time. {$\blacksquare$} The galaxy-integrated depletion timescale for converting the gas into stars depends primarily on z or Hubble time and, at a given z, on the vertical location of a galaxy along the star-formation rate versus stellar mass main sequence (MS) correlation. {$\blacksquare$} Global rates of galaxy gas accretion primarily control the evolution of the cold molecular gas content and star-formation rates of the dominant MS galaxy population, which in turn vary with cosmological expansion. Another key driver may be global disk fragmentation in high- z, gas-rich galaxies, which ties local free-fall timescales to galactic orbital times and leads to rapid radial matter transport and bulge growth. The low star-formation efficiency inside molecular clouds is plausibly set by supersonic streaming motions and internal turbulence, which in turn may be driven by conversion of gravitational energy at high z and/or by local feedback from massive stars at low z. {$\blacksquare$} A simple gas regulator model is remarkably successful in predicting the combined evolution of molecular gas fractions, star-formation rates, galactic winds, and gas-phase metallicities.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Astronomy, Volume 58 is August 18, 2020.

A large fraction of the new stars form in the central kiloparsec of the galaxy1\textendash 3, a region that is comparable in size to the massive, quiescent galaxies found at the peak of cosmic star-formation history4 and the cores of present-day giant elliptical galaxies. The physical and kinematic properties inside these compact starburst cores are poorly understood because probing them at relevant spatial scales requires extremely high angular resolution. Here we report observations with a linear resolution of 550 parsecs of gas and dust in an unlensed, submillimetre-bright galaxy at a redshift of z = 4.3, when the Universe was less than two billion years old. We resolve the spatial and kinematic structure of the molecular gas inside the heavily dust-obscured core and show that the underlying gas disk is clumpy and rotationally supported (that is, its rotation velocity is larger than the velocity dispersion). Our analysis of the molecular gas mass per unit area suggests that the starburst disk is gravitationally unstable, which implies that the self-gravity of the gas is stronger than the differential rotation of the disk and the internal pressure due to stellar-radiation feedback. As a result of the gravitational instability in the disk, the molecular gas would be consumed by star formation on a timescale of 100 million years, which is comparable to gas depletion times in merging starburst galaxies5.},

  abstract = {The mass (M ) of a star can be evaluated from its spectroscopically determined effective temperature (Teff ) and metallicity ([Fe/H]) along with the luminosity (L; derived from parallax), while comparing them with grids of theoretical evolutionary tracks. It has been argued, however, that such a track-based mass (Mtrk) may tend to be overestimated for the case of red giants. Meanwhile, there is an alternative approach of evaluating mass (MgLT ) directly from surface gravity (g), L, and Teff . The practical reliability of MgLT was examined for {$\sim$} 100 benchmark giants in the Kepler field, for which atmospheric parameters are already determined and the reliable mass (Mseis) along with the evolutionary status are known from asteroseismology. In addition, similar check was also made for the accuracy of Mtrk for comparison. It turned out that, while a reasonable correlation is seen between MgLT and Mseis almost irrespective of the stellar property, its precision is rather insufficient because log(MgLT /Mseis) distributes rather widely within {$\sim$} {$\pm$}0.2\textendash 0.3 dex. In contrast, the reliability of Mtrk was found to depend on the evolutionary status. Although Mtrk and Mseis are satisfactorily consistent with each other (typical dispersion of log(Mtrk/Mseis) is within {$\sim$} {$\pm$} 0.1 dex) for H-burning red giants as well as He-burning 2nd clump giants of higher mass, Mtrk tends to be considerably overestimated as compared to Mseis by up to 0.4 dex for He-burning 1st clump giants of lower mass. Accordingly, MgLT and Mtrk are complementary with each other in terms of their characteristic merit and demerit.},

This is consistent with a scenario in which these galaxies have low metallicity, causing an increased CO-to-H\_2 conversion factor, i.e., weaker CO-emission for a given molecular (H\_2) mass. The required metallicities at z{$>$}3 are lower than predicted by the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) at these redshifts, consistent with independent evidence.

  abstract = {Lock-free data structures guarantee overall system progress, whereas wait-free data structures guarantee the progress of each and every thread, providing the desirable non-starvation guarantee for concurrent data structures. While practical lock-free implementations are known for various data structures, wait-free data structure designs are rare. Wait-free implementations have been notoriously hard to design and often inefficient. In this work we present a transformation of lock-free algorithms to wait-free ones allowing even a nonexpert to transform a lock-free data-structure into a practical wait-free one. The transformation requires that the lock-free data structure is given in a normalized form defined in this work. Using the new method, we have designed and implemented wait-free linked-list, skiplist, and tree and we measured their performance. It turns out that for all these data structures the wait-free implementations are only a few percent slower than their lock-free counterparts, while still guaranteeing non-starvation.},

  abstract = {We present The Payne, a general method for the precise and simultaneous determination of numerous stellar labels from observed spectra, based on fitting physical spectral models. The Payne combines a number of important methodological aspects: it exploits the information from much of the available spectral range; it fits all labels (stellar parameters and element abundances) simultaneously; it uses spectral models, where the atmosphere structure and the radiative transport are consistently calculated to reflect the stellar labels. At its core The Payne has an approach to accurate and precise interpolation and prediction of the spectrum in high-dimensional label-space, which is flexible and robust, yet based on only a moderate number of ab initio models (O(1000) for 25 labels). With a simple neural-net-like functional form and a suitable choice of training labels, this interpolation yields a spectral flux prediction good to \$10\^\{-3\}\$ rms across a wide range of \$T\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}\$ and log g (including dwarfs and giants). We illustrate the power of this approach by applying it to the APOGEE DR14 data set, drawing on Kurucz models with recently improved line lists: without recalibration, we obtain physically sensible stellar parameters as well as 15 element abundances that appear to be more precise than the published APOGEE DR14 values. In short, The Payne is an approach that for the first time combines all these key ingredients, necessary for progress towards optimal modelling of survey spectra; and it leads to both precise and accurate estimates of stellar labels, based on physical models and without re-calibration. Both the codes and catalog are made publicly available online.},

  abstract = {It has long been known that the vertical motions of Galactic disk stars increase with stellar age, commonly interpreted as vertical heating through orbit scattering. Here we map the vertical actions of disk stars as a function of age (\$\textbackslash tau\textbackslash le\$ 8 Gyrs) and across a large range of Galactocentric radii, \$\textbackslash overline\{R\}\_\{\textbackslash rm GC\}\$, drawing on APOGEE and Gaia data. We fit \$\textbackslash widehat\{J\_z\}(\textbackslash overline\{R\}\_\{\textbackslash rm GC\},\textbackslash tau )\$ as a combination of the vertical action at birth, \$\textbackslash widehat\{J\_\{z,0\}\}\$, and subsequent heating \$\textbackslash widehat\{\textbackslash Delta J\_z\}\_\{\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm 1Gyr\}\}(\textbackslash overline\{R\}\_\{\textbackslash rm GC\})\$ that scales as \$\textbackslash tau\^\{\textbackslash gamma(\textbackslash overline\{R\}\_\{\textbackslash rm GC\})\}\$. The inferred birth temperature, \$\textbackslash widehat\{J\_\{z,0\}\}(\textbackslash overline\{R\}\_\{\textbackslash rm GC\})\$ is 1 kpc km/s for 3 kpc {$<$} \$\textbackslash overline\{R\}\_\{\textbackslash rm GC\}\$ {$<$} 10 kpc, consistent with the ISM velocity dispersion; but it rapidly rises outward, to 8 kpc km/s for \$\textbackslash overline\{R\}\_\{\textbackslash rm GC\}\$ = 14 kpc, likely reflecting the stars' birth in a warped or flared gas disk. We find the heating rate \$\textbackslash widehat\{\textbackslash Delta J\_z\}\_\{\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm 1Gyr\}\}\$ to be modest and nearly constant across all radii, 1.6 kpc km/s Gyr\$\^\{-1\}\$. The stellar age dependence \$\textbackslash gamma\$ gently grows with Galactocentric radius, from \$\textbackslash gamma \textbackslash simeq\$ 1 for \$\textbackslash overline\{R\}\_\{\textbackslash rm GC\}\textbackslash lesssim R\_\textbackslash odot\$ to \$\textbackslash gamma \textbackslash simeq\$ 1.3 at \$\textbackslash overline\{R\}\_\{\textbackslash rm GC\}\$ =14 kpc. The observed \$J\_z - \textbackslash tau\$ relation at all radii is considerably steeper (\$\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash gtrsim\$ 1) than the time dependence theoretically expected from orbit scattering, \$J\_z\textbackslash propto t\^\{0.5\}\$. We illustrate how this conundrum can be resolved if we also account for the fact that at earlier epochs the scatterers were more common, and the restoring force from the stellar disk surface mass density was low. Our analysis may re-instate gradual orbital scattering as a plausible and viable mechanism to explain the age-dependent vertical motions of disk stars.},

  abstract = {The application of Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics has flourished over the past decade, spurred by data sets of increasing size and complexity. In many respects, Bayesian methods have proven to be vastly superior to more traditional statistical tools, offering the advantage of higher efficiency and of a consistent conceptual basis for dealing with the problem of induction in the presence of uncertainty. This trend is likely to continue in the future, when the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings, Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are summarized, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},

  abstract = {The gas surrounding galaxies outside their disks or ISM and inside their virial radii is known as the ``circumgalactic medium'' (CGM). In recent years this component of galaxies has assumed an important role in our understanding of galaxy evolution owing to rapid advances in observational access to this diffuse, nearly invisible material. Observations and simulations of this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium characterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The CGM is a source for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and recycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review our evolving knowledge of the CGM with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state, and co-evolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across the electromagnetic spectrum indicate that CGM gas has a key role in galaxy evolution. We summarize the state of this field and pose unanswered questions for future research.},

We reliably detected the emission of CO(5-4), CO(2-1), and CO(7-6)+[CI](2-1) in 50, 33, and 13 galaxies, respectively, and we complemented this information with available CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) fluxes for part of the sample, and modeling of the optical-to-mm SEDs. We retrieve a quasi-linear relation between LIR and CO(5-4) or CO(7-6) for main-sequence galaxies and starbursts, corroborating the hypothesis that these transitions can be used as SFR tracers. We find the CO excitation to steadily increase as a function of the star formation efficiency, the mean intensity of the radiation field warming the dust, the surface density of SFR, and, less distinctly, with the distance from the main sequence. This adds to the tentative evidence for higher excitation of the CO+[CI] SLED of starbursts relative to that for main-sequence objects, where the dust opacities play a minor role in shaping the high-J CO transitions in our sample. However, the distinction between the average SLED of upper main-sequence and starburst galaxies is blurred, driven by a wide variety of intrinsic shapes. LVG radiative transfer modeling demonstrates the existence of a highly excited component that elevates the CO SLED of high-redshift main-sequence and starbursting galaxies above the typical values observed in the disk of the Milky Way. This excited component is dense and it encloses \textasciitilde 50\% of the total molecular gas mass in main-sequence objects. We interpret the observed trends involving the CO excitation as mainly driven by a combination of large SFRs and compact sizes, naturally connected with enhanced dense molecular gas fractions and higher dust and gas temperatures, due to increasing UV radiation fields, cosmic ray rates, and dust/gas coupling.

The population of clusters in the central 10 kpc has a mean rotational velocity reaching 50-80 km s-1 , and a nearly isotropic velocity dispersion 100-120 km s-1 , while in the outer galaxy, the cluster orbits are strongly radially anisotropic. We confirm a concentration of clusters at high radial action in the outer region of the Galaxy. Finally, we explore a range of equilibrium distribution function-based models for the entire globular cluster system, and the information they provide about the potential of the Milky Way. The dynamics of clusters is best described by models with the circular velocity between 10 and 50 kpc staying in the range 210-240 km s-1},

  abstract = {We introduce a new adaptive and fully Bayesian grid-based method to model strong gravitational lenses with extended images. The primary goal of this method is to quantify the level of luminous and dark mass substructure in massive galaxies, through their effect on highly magnified arcs and Einstein rings. The method is adaptive on the source plane, where a Delaunay tessellation is defined according to the lens mapping of a regular grid on to the source plane. The Bayesian penalty function allows us to recover the best non-linear potential-model parameters and/or a grid-based potential correction and to objectively quantify the level of regularization for both the source and potential. In addition, we implement a Nested-Sampling technique to quantify the errors on all non-linear mass model parameters - marginalized over all source and regularization parameters - and allow an objective ranking of different potential models in terms of the marginalized evidence. In particular, we are interested in comparing very smooth lens mass models with ones that contain mass substructures. The algorithm has been tested on a range of simulated data sets, created from a model of a realistic lens system. One of the lens systems is characterized by a smooth potential with a power-law density profile, 12 include a Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) dark matter substructure of different masses and at different positions and one contains two NFW dark substructures with the same mass but with different positions. Reconstruction of the source and lens potential for all of these systems shows the method is able, in a realistic scenario, to identify perturbations with masses {$\greaterequivlnt$}107 M {$\odot$} when located on the Einstein ring. For positions both inside and outside of the ring, masses of at least 109 M{$\odot$} are required (i.e. roughly the Einstein ring of the perturber needs to overlap with that of the main lens). Our method provides a fully novel and objective test of mass substructure in massive galaxies. \textcopyright{} 2008 RAS.},

Traditional \$\textbackslash widehat\{R\}\$ will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles.

  abstract = {Surface abundances of C, N, and O in red giants are affected by processed material mixed into the stars' convective envelopes. Using a sample of \$\textbackslash sim 5100\$ stars with elemental abundances from APOGEE and asteroseismic masses from \{\textbackslash it Kepler\}, we test theoretical stellar models that predict this mixing, then apply these models to derive birth C, N, and O abundances for these stars. Our models with standard mixing can reproduce the observed trends to within plausible uncertainties in the birth abundances. Some models with ''extra'' mixing processes fail, predicting trends with surface gravity or evolutionary state that are not observed. Applying mixing corrections to the APOGEE abundances removes the observed age-dependence of log(N/O) and log(C/N), but it leaves trends of log(N/O) and log(C/N) with metallicity, as expected based on nucleosynthesis models. The stellar N/O trend agrees well with Dopita et al.'s calibration of gas phase log(N/O) with metallicity, and with gas phase trends in the MaNGA integral field survey of nearby galaxies. We also find a substantial separation in birth [N/Mg] ratios between high-[\$\textbackslash alpha\$/Fe] (''thick disc'') stars and low-[\$\textbackslash alpha\$/Fe] (''thin disc'') stars. We find a smaller but still clear separation for [C/Mg]. The trends of birth C and N abundances with [Fe/H] and [\$\textbackslash alpha\$/Fe] could affect spectroscopic age estimates for red giants that rely on the observed C/N ratio as a diagnostic of stellar mass.},

  abstract = {We present high-resolution VLA observations of the molecular gas in the host galaxy of the highest redshift quasar currently known, SDSS J1148+5251 (z=6.42). Our VLA data of the CO(3-2) emission have a maximum resolution of 0.17'' x 0.13'' (\textasciitilde 1 kpc), and enable us to resolve the molecular gas emission both spatially and in velocity. The molecular gas in J1148+5251 is extended to a radius of 2.5 kpc, and the central region shows 2 peaks, separated by 0.3'' (1.7 kpc). These peaks account for about half of the total emission, while the remainder is more extended. Each of these unresolved peaks contains a molecular gas mass of \textasciitilde 5 x 10\^9 M\_sun (similar to the total mass found in nearby ULIRGS) and has an intrinsic brightness temperature of \textasciitilde 35 K (averaged over the 1 kpc-sized beam), comparable to what is found in nearby starburst centers. Assuming that the molecular gas is gravitationally bound, we estimate a dynamical mass of \textasciitilde 4.5 x 10\^10 M\_sun within a radius of 2.5 kpc (\textasciitilde 5.5 x 10\^10 M\_sun if corrected for a derived inclination of i\textasciitilde 65 deg.). This dynamical mass estimate leaves little room for matter other than the detected molecular gas, and in particular the data are inconsistent with a \textasciitilde 10\^12 M\_sun stellar bulge which would be predicted based on the M\_BH-sigma\_bulge relation. This finding may indicate that black holes form prior to the assembly of the stellar bulges and that the dark matter halos are less massive than predicted based on the black hole/bulge mass relationship.},

In total 14 cluster members with \$M\_\{*\} {$>$} 10\^\{10.5\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ are detected, including all the massive star-forming members within the virial radius, providing the largest galaxy sample in a single cluster at \$z {$>$} 2\$ with CO(1-0) measurements. We find a large variety in the gas content of these cluster galaxies, which is correlated with their relative positions (or accretion states), with those closer to the cluster core being increasingly gas-poor. Moreover, despite their low gas content, the galaxies in the cluster center exhibit an elevated star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/\$M\_\{\textbackslash rm gas\}\$) compared to field galaxies, suggesting that the suppression on the SFR is likely delayed compared to that on the gas content. Their gas depletion time is around \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm dep\} \textbackslash sim 400\$ Myrs, comparable to the cluster dynamical time. This implies that they will likely consume all their gas within a single orbit around the cluster center, and form a passive cluster core by \$z\textbackslash sim2\$. This result is one of the first direct pieces of evidence for the influence of environment on the gas reservoirs and SFE of \$z {$>$} 2\$ cluster galaxies, thereby providing new insights into the rapid formation and quenching of the most massive galaxies in the early universe.},

The classes include: i) estimating Galactic escape velocity using high velocity objects; ii) measuring the rotation curve through terminal and circular velocities; iii) modeling halo stars, globular clusters and satellite galaxies with the spherical Jeans equation and iv) with phase-space distribution functions; v) simulating and modeling the dynamics of stellar streams and their progenitors; vi) modeling the motion of the Milky Way, M31 and other distant satellites under the framework of Local Group timing argument; and vii) measurements made by linking the brightest Galactic satellites to their counterparts in simulations. For each class of methods, we introduce their theoretical and observational background, the method itself, the sample of available tracer objects, model assumptions, uncertainties, limits and the corresponding measurements that have been achieved in the past. Both the measured total masses within the radial range probed by tracer objects and the extrapolated virial masses are discussed and quoted. We also discuss the role of modern numerical simulations in terms of helping to validate model assumptions, understanding systematic uncertainties and calibrating the measurements. While measurements in the last two decades show a factor of two scatters, recent measurements using Gaia DR2 data are approaching a higher precision. We end with a detailed discussion of future developments in the field, especially as the size and quality of the observational data will increase tremendously with current and future surveys. In such cases, the systematic uncertainties will be dominant and thus will necessitate a much more rigorous testing and characterization of the various mass determination methods.},

The second Gaia data release (DR2) contained a catalogue of absolute proper motions (PMs) for a set of Galactic globular clusters and satellite galaxies measured using Gaia DR2 data. We select from the catalogue only halo GCs, identifying a total of 34 GCs spanning 2.0 {$\leq$} r {$\leq$} 21.1 kpc, and use their 3D kinematics to estimate the anisotropy over this range to be {$\beta$} = 0.46+0.15-0.19, in good agreement, though slightly lower than, a recent estimate for a sample of halo GCs using HST PM measurements further out in the halo. We then use the Gaia kinematics to estimate the mass of the MW inside the outermost GC to be M({$<$} 21.1 kpc) = 0.21+0.04-0.03\texttimes{} 1012M{$\odot$}, which corresponds to a circular velocity at rmaxof vcirc(21.1 kpc) = 206+19-16kms-1. The implied virial mass is Mvirial = 1.28+0.97-0.48\texttimes{} 1012M{$\odot$}. The error bars encompass the uncertainties on the anisotropy and on the density profile of the MW dark halo, and the scatter inherent in the mass estimator we use. We get improved estimates when we combine the Gaia and HST samples to provide kinematics for 46 GCs out to 39.5 kpc: {$\beta$} = 0.52+0.11-0.14,M({$<$} 39.5 kpc) = 0.42+0.07-0.06\texttimes{} 1012M{$\odot$}, and Mvirial= 1.54+0.75-0.44\texttimes{} 1012M{$\odot$}. We show that these results are robust to potential substructure in the halo GC distribution. While a wide range of MW virial masses have been advocated in the literature, from below 1012M{$\odot$}to above 2 \texttimes{} 1012M{$\odot$}, these new data imply that an intermediate mass is most likely.},

  abstract = {Satellite galaxies in rich clusters are subject to numerous physical processes that can significantly influence their evolution. However, the typical L* satellite galaxy resides in much lower mass galaxy groups, where the processes capable of altering their evolution are generally weaker and have had less time to operate. To investigate the extent to which satellite and central galaxy evolution differs, we separately model the stellar mass-halo mass (M *-Mh ) relation for these two populations over the redshift interval 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 1. This relation for central galaxies is constrained by the galaxy stellar mass function while the relation for satellite galaxies is constrained against recent measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function (2PCF). Our approach does not rely on the abundance matching technique but instead adopts a flexible functional form for the relation between satellite galaxy stellar mass and subhalo mass, where subhalo mass is considered as the maximum mass that a subhalo has ever reached in its merger history, M peak. At z {$\sim$} 0 the satellites, on average, have {$\sim$}10\% larger stellar masses at fixed M peak compared to central galaxies of the same halo mass (although the two relations are consistent at 2{$\sigma$}-3{$\sigma$} for M peak {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1013 M O). This is required in order to reproduce the observed stellar mass-dependent 2PCF and satellite fractions. At low masses our model slightly under-predicts the correlation function at {$\sim$}1 Mpc scales. At z {$\sim$} 1 the satellite and central galaxy M *-Mh relations are consistent within the errors, and the model provides an excellent fit to the clustering data. At present, the errors on the clustering data at z {$\sim$} 2 are too large to constrain the satellite model. A simple model in which satellite and central galaxies share the same M *-Mh relation is able to reproduce the extant z {$\sim$} 2 clustering data. We speculate that the striking similarity between the satellite and central galaxy M *-M h relations since z {$\sim$} 2 arises because the central galaxy relation evolves very weakly with time and because the stellar mass of the typical satellite galaxy has not changed significantly since it was accreted. The reason for this last point is not yet entirely clear, but it is likely related to the fact that the typical {$\sim$}L* satellite galaxy resides in a poor group where transformation processes are weak and lifetimes are short. \textcopyright{} 2013.

  abstract = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here, we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multivariate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This galaxy-halo connection provides a key test of physical galaxy-formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy-formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10 12 M o, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

The sources were selected to have S\_1.4mm{$>$}20 mJy and a dust-like spectrum and, to remove low-z sources, not have bright radio (S\_843MHz{$<$}6mJy) or far-infrared counterparts (S\_100um{$<$}1 Jy, S\_60um{$<$}200mJy). We robustly detect 44 line features in our survey, which we identify as redshifted emission lines of 12CO, 13CO, [CI], H2O, and H2O+. We find one or more spectral features in 23 sources yielding a \textasciitilde 90\% detection rate for this survey; in 12 of these sources we detect multiple lines, while in 11 sources we detect only a single line. For the sources with only one detected line, we break the redshift degeneracy with additional spectroscopic observations if available, or infer the most likely line identification based on photometric data. This yields secure redshifts for \textasciitilde 70\% of the sample. The three sources with no lines detected are tentatively placed in the redshift desert between 1.73. We discuss the effect of gravitational lensing on the redshift distribution and compare our measured redshift distribution to that of models in the literature.},

  abstract = {We present the KMOS3D survey, a new integral field survey of over 600 galaxies at 0.7 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.7 using KMOS at the Very Large Telescope. The KMOS3D survey utilizes synergies with multi-wavelength ground- and space-based surveys to trace the evolution of spatially resolved kinematics and star formation from a homogeneous sample over 5 Gyr of cosmic history. Targets, drawn from a mass-selected parent sample from the 3D-HST survey, cover the star formation-stellar mass (M {${_\ast}$}) and rest-frame (U-V)-M {${_\ast}$} planes uniformly. We describe the selection of targets, the observations, and the data reduction. In the first-year of data we detect H{$\alpha$} emission in 191 M {${_\ast}$} = 3 \texttimes{} 109-7 \texttimes{} 1011 M{$\odot$} galaxies at z = 0.7-1.1 and z = 1.9-2.7. In the current sample 83\% of the resolved galaxies are rotation dominated, determined from a continuous velocity gradient and v rot/{$\sigma$}0 {$>$} 1, implying that the star-forming "main sequence" is primarily composed of rotating galaxies at both redshift regimes. When considering additional stricter criteria, the H{$\alpha$} kinematic maps indicate that at least {$\sim$}70\% of the resolved galaxies are disk-like systems. Our high-quality KMOS data confirm the elevated velocity dispersions reported in previous integral field spectroscopy studies at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.7. For rotation-dominated disks, the average intrinsic velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of two from 50 km s-1at z {$\sim$} 2.3 to 25 km s-1at z {$\sim$} 0.9. Combined with existing results spanning z {$\sim$} 0-3, we show that disk velocity dispersions follow an evolution that is consistent with the dependence of velocity dispersion on gas fractions predicted by marginally stable disk theory.},

One of the scientific objectives of the project is for better understanding the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. Thus, credible derivation of the physical properties of the stars plays a key role for the exploration. We developed and implemented the LAMOST stellar parameter pipeline (LASP) which can automatically determine the fundamental stellar atmospheric parameters (effective temperature Teff , surface gravity log g, metallicity [Fe/H], radial velocity Vr) for late A, FGK type stars observed during the survey. An overview of the LASP, including the strategy, the algorithm and the process is presented in this work.},

  abstract = {We present a method called Significant Cosmic Holes in Universe (SCHU) for identifying cosmic voids and loops of filaments in cosmological datasets and assigning their statistical significance using techniques from topological data analysis. In particular, persistent homology is used to find different dimensional holes. For dark matter halo catalogs and galaxy surveys, the 0-, 1-, and 2-dimensional holes can be identified with connected components (i.e. clusters), loops of filaments, and voids. The procedure overlays dark matter halos/galaxies on a three-dimensional grid, and a distance-to-measure (DTM) function is calculated at each point of the grid. A nested set of simplicial complexes (a filtration) is generated over the lower-level sets of the DTM across increasing threshold values. The filtered simplicial complex can then be used to summarize the birth and death times of the different dimension homology group generators (i.e., the holes). Persistent homology summary diagrams, called persistence diagrams, are produced from the dimension, birth times, and death times of each homology group generator. Using the persistence diagrams and bootstrap sampling, we explain how p-values can be assigned to each homology group generator. The homology group generators on a persistence diagram are not, in general, uniquely located back in the original dataset volume so we propose a method for finding a representation of the homology group generators. This method provides a novel, statistically rigorous approach for locating informative generators in cosmological datasets, which may be useful for providing complementary cosmological constraints on the effects of, for example, the sum of the neutrino masses. The method is tested on a Voronoi foam simulation, and then subsequently applied to a subset of the SDSS galaxy survey and a cosmological simulation. Lastly, we calculate Betti functions for two of the MassiveNuS simulations and discuss implications for using the persistent homology of the density field to help break degeneracy in the cosmological parameters.},

Our sample comprises 2401 rigorously selected Blue Horizontal-Branch (BHB) halo stars drawn from SDSS DR-6. To interpret these distributions, we compare them to matched mock observations drawn from two different cosmological galaxy formation simulations designed to resemble the Milky Way, which we presume to have an appropriate orbital distribution of halo stars. We then determine which value of \$\textbackslash rm V\_\{cir\}(r)\$ brings the observed distribution into agreement with the corresponding distributions from the simulations. This procedure results in an estimate of the Milky Way's circular velocity curve to \$\textbackslash sim 60\$ kpc, which is found to be slightly falling from the adopted value of \$\textbackslash rm 220 km s\^\{-1\}\$ at the Sun's location, and implies M\$({$<$}60 \textbackslash rm kpc) = 4.0\textbackslash pm 0.7\textbackslash times 10\^\{11\}\$M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$. The radial dependence of \$\textbackslash rm V\_\{cir\}(r)\$, derived in statistically independent bins, is found to be consistent with the expectations from an NFW dark matter halo with the established stellar mass components at its center. If we assume an NFW halo profile of characteristic concentration holds, we can use the observations to estimate the virial mass of the Milky Way's dark matter halo, M\$\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}=1.0\^\{+0.3\}\_\{-0.2\} \textbackslash times 10\^\{12\}\$M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$, which is lower than many previous estimates. This estimate implies that nearly 40\% of the baryons within the virial radius of the Milky Way's dark matter halo reside in the stellar components of our Galaxy. A value for M\$\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}\$ of only \$\textbackslash sim 1\textbackslash times10\^\{12\}\$M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ also (re-)opens the question of whether all of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies are on bound orbits.},

After excising stars that were algorithmically attributed to apparent halo substructure (including the Sagittarius stream), the sample has 1757 K giants, with a typical metallicity precision of 0.2 dex and a mean distance accuracy of 16\%. Compared to blue horizontal branch stars or RR Lyrae variables, giants are more readily understood tracers of the overall halo star population, with less bias in age or metallicity. The well-characterized selection function of the sample enables forward modeling of those data, based on ellipsoidal stellar density models, {$\nu{_\ast}$}(R, z), with Einasto profiles and (broken) power laws for their radial dependence, combined with a model for the metallicity gradient and the flattening profile. Among models with constant flattening, these data are reasonably well fit by an Einasto profile of n = 3.1 {$\pm$} 0.5 with an effective radius and a flattening of q = 0.7 {$\pm$} 0.02, or comparably well by an equally flattened broken power law, with radial slopes of in = 2.1 {$\pm$} 0.3 and out = 3.8 {$\pm$} 0.1, with a break radius of rbreak = 18 {$\pm$} 1 kpc; this is largely consistent with earlier work. We find a modest but significant metallicity gradient within the "outer" stellar halo, [Fe/H] decreasing outward. If we allow for a variable flattening , we find the distribution of halo giants to be considerably more flattened at small radii, q(10 kpc) = 0.55 {$\pm$} 0.02, compared to q({$>$}30 kpc) = 0.8 {$\pm$} 0.03. Remarkably, the data are then very well fit by a single power law with index of 4.2 {$\pm$} 0.1 on the variable rq {$\equiv$} {$\surd$}R2 +(z/r))2. In this simple and better-fitting model, there is a break in flattening at {$\sim$}20 kpc, instead of a break in the radial density function. While different parameterizations of the radial profile vary in their parameters, their implied density gradient, , is stable along a direction intermediate between major and minor axis; this gradient is crucial in any dynamical modeling that uses halo stars as tracers.},

  abstract = {The detailed age-chemical abundance relations of stars measures time-dependent chemical evolution. These trends offer strong empirical constraints on nucleosynthetic processes, as well as the homogeneity of star-forming gas. Characterizing chemical abundances of stars across the Milky Way over time has been made possible very recently, thanks to surveys like Gaia, APOGEE and Kepler. Studies of the low-{$\alpha$} disk have shown that individual elements have unique age-abundance trends and the intrinsic dispersion around these relations is small. In this study, we examine and compare the age distribution of stars across both the high and low-{$\alpha$} disk and quantify the intrinsic dispersion of 16 elements around their age-abundance relations at [Fe/H] = 0 using APOGEE DR16. We find the high-{$\alpha$} disk has shallower age-abundance relations compared to the low-{$\alpha$} disk, but similar median intrinsic dispersions of {$\approx$} 0.04 dex, suggesting universal element production mechanisms for the high and low-{$\alpha$} disks, despite differences in formation history. We visualize the temporal and spatial distribution of disk stars in small chemical cells, revealing signatures of upside-down and inside-out formation. Further, the metallicity skew and the [Fe/H]-age relations across radius indicates different initial metallicity gradients and evidence for radial migration. Our study is accompanied by an age catalogue for 64,317 stars in APOGEE derived using The Cannon with {$\approx$} 1.9 Gyr uncertainty across all ages (APO-CAN stars) as well as a red clump catalogue of 22,031 stars with a contamination rate of 2.7\%.},

Peasants justify illegal tree cutting by pointing to China's rapidly increasing inequalities, their lack of economic opportunity, and the absence of economic support from the (corrupt) government. These issues, combined with continuing institutional problems with forest management after decollectivization, convince peasants that ignoring environmental conservation edicts and cashing in on their trees is good-choice. This study identifies relative poverty and social discontent as major factors driving deforestation.},

Our sample comprises galaxies with a stellar mass range of 1x10\^9M\_sun - 4x10\^11M\_sun with a mean M\_*\textasciitilde 6x10\^10M\_sun. Combining these measurements with multiwavelength observations and SED modeling, we characterize the gas mass fraction and the star formation efficiency, and infer the impact of the environment on galaxies' evolution. Most of our detected galaxies (\textasciitilde 70\%) have star formation efficiencies and gas fractions similar to those found for coeval field galaxies and in agreement with the field scaling relations. However, we do find that the proto-clusters contain an increased fraction of massive, gas-poor galaxies, with low gas fractions (f\_gas{$<$}6-10\%) and red rest-frame ultraviolet/optical colors typical of post-starburst and passive galaxies. The relatively high abundance of passive galaxies suggests an accelerated evolution of massive galaxies in proto-cluster environments. The large fraction of quenched galaxies in these overdense structures also implies that environmental quenching takes place during the early phases of cluster assembly, even before virialization. From our data, we derive a quenching efficiency of E\_q\textasciitilde 0.45 and an upper limit on the quenching timescale of T\_q{$<$}1Gyr.},

An important source of information about the local correlation and scale is given by the Hessian matrix of the target distribution, but this is often either computationally expensive or infeasible. In this paper we propose MCMC samplers that make use of quasiNewton approximations, which approximate the Hessian of the target distribution from previous samples and gradients generated by the sampler. A key issue is that MCMC samplers that depend on the history of previous states are in general not valid. We address this problem by using limited memory quasi-Newton methods, which depend only on a fixed window of previous samples. On several real world datasets, we show that the quasi-Newton sampler is more effective than standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo at a fraction of the cost of MCMC methods that require higher-order derivatives.},

Recent work studies the ``forward'' KL KL(p||q), which unlike reverse KL does not lead to variational approximations that underestimate uncertainty. This paper introduces Transport Score Climbing (TSC), a method that optimizes KL(p||q) by using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and a novel adaptive transport map. The transport map improves the trajectory of HMC by acting as a change of variable between the latent variable space and a warped space. TSC uses HMC samples to dynamically train the transport map while optimizing KL(p||q). TSC leverages synergies, where better transport maps lead to better HMC sampling, which then leads to better transport maps. We demonstrate TSC on synthetic and real data. We find that TSC achieves competitive performance when training variational autoencoders on large-scale data.},

  abstract = {Context. In Gaia DR2, an unprecedented high level of precision has been reached at sub-milliarcsecond for astrometry and millimagnitudes for photometry. Using cluster members identified with the astrometry and photometry in Gaia DR2, we can obtain a reliable determination of cluster properties. However, because of the shortcomings of Gaia spectroscopic observations in dealing with densely crowded cluster regions, the RVs and metallicity values for cluster member stars from Gaia DR2 are still lacking. It is necessary to combine the Gaia data with the data from large spectroscopic surveys, such as LAMOST, APOGEE, GALAH, and Gaia-ESO.},
