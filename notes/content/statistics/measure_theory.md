# Measure Theory

## $\sigma$-Algebra

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
A **$\sigma$-field** or **$\sigma$-algebra** on the set $\Omega$ is a collection of subsets of $\mathbb{P}(\Omega)$, called the **measurable sets**, with the following properties:

- it is not empty: $\emptyset, \Omega \in \mathcal{F}$
- it is closed under complement: $A \in \mathcal{F} \implies A^c \in \mathcal{F}$
- it is closed under countable unions and intersections: for $A_i \in \mathcal{F}, i \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $\cup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i \in \mathcal{F}$ and $\cap_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i \in \mathcal{F}$

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
For a given (general) subset $M \subseteq \mathbb{P}(\Omega)$, there is a smallest $\sigma$-algebra that contains the set $M$. We call this the **$\sigma$-algebra generated by $M$**, and it is defined as
\begin{align}
\sigma(M) = \bigcap_{\substack{{M \subseteq \mathcal{F}}\\{\mathcal{F}~\text{$\sigma$-algebra}}}} \mathcal{F}.
\end{align}

An important $\sigma$-algebra is the **Borel $\sigma$-algebra**, which is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by all open sets. The elements it contains are called **Borel sets**, which are the sets that can be formed from open sets through unions, intersections, and (relative) complements.

For a random variable $X$, the **$\sigma$-algebra generated by the random variable $X$** contains all of the inverse images $X^{-1}(B)$ of all the Borel sets $B \subset \mathbb{R}$. That is, it contains the set of all points $\omega \in \Omega$ where $X(\omega) \in B$ for some Borel set $B \subset \mathbb{R}$.

For a stochastic process $X = (X_t, t \in T, \omega \in \Omega)$, the $\sigma$-algebra $\sigma(X)$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing all sets of the form ${\omega: X_t(\omega) \in C}$ for any Borel sets $C$. For a "nice" function $f$ acting on $X$, $\sigma(f(X)) \subset \sigma(X)$. That is, $f$ does not provide any new information about the structure of $X$.

## Measures

For a set $X$ and a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ defined on $X$, the tuple $(X, \mathcal{F})$ is called a measurable space. We can then define a function $\mu: \mathcal{R} \rightarrow [0, \infty]$, which we call a **measure** if it satisfies the following conditions:

- $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$
- $\mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty} A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i$ for all $A_i \in \mathcal{F}$ with $i \in \mathbb{N}, A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset, i \neq j$ (i.e., disjoint sets in $\mathcal{F}$)

The tuple $(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ is called a **measure space**.

```{note}
Note that the codomain of a measure includes $\infty$. It is called the [extended real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_real_number_line). In this set $[0, \infty]$, calculations work as follows:

- $\forall x \in [0, \infty], x + \infty = \infty$
- $\forall x \in (0, \infty], x * \infty = \infty$
- $0 * \infty = 0$ (in most cases in measure theory)
