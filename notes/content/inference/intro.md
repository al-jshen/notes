# Inference/sampling

Problem: Given a known probability distribution, how do you compute integrals with it (i.e., expectation values involving that distribution, like means, variances, marginal likelihoods)?

Motivation for sampling: probability distributions can be hard to work with. But if you have samples from the distribution, you can easily calculate expectation values involving that distribution using those samples. You can also use those samples to run simulations (generative modelling).
